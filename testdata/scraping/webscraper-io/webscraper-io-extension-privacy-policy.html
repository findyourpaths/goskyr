		<p>With Web Scraper we not only want to make web data extraction easy and accessible for its users,
			but also sincerely care about the protection of users’ personal data and privacy. Just like our users extract
			only the necessary data from different websites, we at Web Scraper also collect and process only the absolutely
			necessary personal data of Web Scraper users to provide you with the most suitable data extraction tool for your needs.
			If Web Scraper allows you to navigate websites more efficiently, then this privacy policy
			(“<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) is designed to ease your navigation and understanding of the protection of your
			privacy and processing of your personal data carried out by Web Scraper and its developers in accordance with the
			General Data Protection Regulation. Privacy Policy provides information on the reasons for processing your personal
			data, scope, protection, storage periods and sources of your personal data, and, most importantly, your rights
			during the acquisition and processing of personal data.

				<h2>What is meant by these terms in the Privacy Policy</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Web Scraper</strong> – web browser extension for web site data extraction “Web Scraper”
							owned and provided by Latvian limited liability company “Web Graph”, registration number 40203093908,
							headquarter address: Ubelu 5-71, Adazi, Latvia, LV-2164 (“<strong>Web Graph</strong>”;
							“<strong>we</strong>”’; “<strong>us</strong>”).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>GDPR</strong> – Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
							April 2016 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the
							free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Personal data</strong> – any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
							person; an identifiable natural person shall be one which may be identified directly or indirectly, in
							particular by reference to an identifier, such as the name, surname, location data, online identifier.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Non-Personal data</strong> – any information that cannot be used to identify a natural person.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Personal data processing</strong> – any activity or set of activities, which are performed
							on Personal data or on sets of Personal data with or without automated means, such as collecting,
							recording, organising, structuring, storing, adapting or transforming, recapturing, viewing, using,
							disclosing, transmitting, disseminating or otherwise making available, comparing or restricting
							Personal data or Personal data sets, removal, erasure or destruction of Personal data.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Controller</strong> – a natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with others, determines
							the purposes and means of Personal data processing, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy and
							regarding Web Scraper – Controller of Personal data processing is Web Graph.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>User</strong> – a natural person who uses Web Scraper or other services.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Data subject</strong> – a natural person identified or identifiable directly or indirectly,
							in some cases – the User.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>User’s consent</strong> – any freely provided, specific, informed and unequivocal reference
							to the wishes of the User, by which the User, in the form of a statement or clearly affirmative
							action, gives consent to the processing of his or her Personal data for a specific purpose.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Sitemap</strong> – a plan for how a website should be traversed and what information should
							be extracted by using Web Scraper.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Community Sitemap suggestion feature</strong> – a sharing feature built in the Web Scraper
							for suggesting already created Sitemaps for respective web addresses to Users when using the Web
							Scraper extension in that particular web address.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>User forum</strong> – online forum at forum.webscraper.io where Users can discuss features,
							ask questions or submit any errors, bugs regarding the use of Web Scraper and provide Sitemaps to
							other Users.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>What Personal data we process and for what purposes</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Web Scraper itself does not collect or process any Personal data of the User immediately after
							installing Web Scraper, however, User’s Personal data may be collected and processed when the
							User uses Web Scraper, contacts us directly or reports an issue or suggestion to us or other Users
							(via User forum) regarding the use of Web Scraper.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							When the User installs Web Scraper, we assign a unique identification number (“
							<strong>ID number</strong>”) to each installation for us to be able to track the amount of active
							Web Scraper Users, however, the User cannot be directly or indirectly identified by the given
							ID number. The ID number only serves as means of separating one User’s account from another without
							being able to identify the User himself/herself. The ID number alongside with Web Scraper
							configuration will be synchronised across multiple browser installations in case when the User has
							enabled browser setting synchronisation globally.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							When the User contacts us directly, we may receive additional information about the User, such as
							name and surname, e-mail address, phone number and other information provided by the User upon
							contacting us.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since Web Scraper can be downloaded for free, we do not collect or process any payment data of the
							User upon downloading Web Scraper.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Basis for processing Personal data</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							We do not require the Users to provide us with their Personal data. Web Scraper can be downloaded
							and used without signing into the User’s Google account and without the User being directly or
							indirectly identified. However, when the User provides us with any information in accordance to
							Section 2 of this Privacy Policy, which can be considered as Personal data, we have a legitimate
							interest to collect and process provided Personal data to provide the Users with Web Scraper and
							Community Sitemap functions, updates and improvements, record the number of downloads and actual
							Users of Web Scraper for the purpose of carrying out Web Scraper business analytics, to respond to
							any requests and queries from the Users, as well as to detect or prevent any illegal activities.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>How we protect and store Personal data</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							We employ a variety of security measures to protect any information received from our Users from
							unauthorized access, use, erasure or disclosure. The measures we use are designed to provide a level
							of security appropriate to the risk of processing Personal data, taking into account financial and
							technological resources reasonably available to us. Our security measures include, but are not limited
							to, transmitting Personal data in an encrypted form from the User to our database by the use of
							TLS/SSL certificates, storing Personal data in secure cloud storages provided by trusted service
							providers, protecting stored information with unique generated passwords, storing Personal data in
							an unidentifiable (pseudonymized) form only referring to individually assigned User ID number,
							which on its own cannot be directly or indirectly linked to a specific person, protecting our e-mail
							by using a unique username and password assigned to each person we employ.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Our chosen cloud storage providers ensure that any information stored on their provided services is
							located on servers based within the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United States of America.
							In cases when any Personal or non-Personal data is being stored outside of the EEA, we make sure the
							respective service provider guarantees and provides the level of protection of stored data which is
							at least equivalent to that of the GDPR.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>For how long we store and retain Personal data</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							We retain Personal data that we collect from the Users where we have an ongoing legitimate business
							need to do so, for example, to provide Users with Web Scraper updates, review and answer Users’
							queries and complaints, or to comply with applicable legal requirements.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							When we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal requirement to process User’s Personal
							data, we will either delete, anonymize or pseudonymize it or, if this is not possible, for example,
							because the User’s Personal data has been stored in backup archives, then we will securely store the
							Personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>Do we transfer Personal data to anyone else</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<div>
							<p>
								We do not transfer any User Personal data processed by us to third parties, unless:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										the User has given clear, unambiguous consent and requested the transfer of their Personal data;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										it is our obligation to disclose such Personal data to the persons provided for in the external
										regulatory enactments, upon a reasoned request, in accordance with the procedures and to the
										extent specified in the external regulatory enactments;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										we have to submit a claim to the court or other State authorities against a person who has
										infringed our legitimate interests.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							We may use and share information about Users (the number of Users, geolocation, number of downloads)
							with our partners in aggregated or de-identified form that can&#39;t reasonably be used to identify the
							User.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>What non-Personal data we collect and process</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<div>
							<p>
								When the User downloads and uses Web Scraper, we may collect non-Personal data of the User to
								provide it with relevant updates, suggestions and chosen functions of Web Scraper, as well as
								for determining User statistics. The data anonymous statistics collection can be managed via browser
								extensions options page. Collected data will include:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										web browser’s version and device’s operating system;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										occasional User surveys and information provided by the Users therein;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										information on when an installation, update, or uninstallation of Web Scraper occurs;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										aggregated usage analytics, including the version of Web Scraper used, version of the web
										browser, amount of data scraped excluding data itself, amount of scraping jobs, amount of
										created Sitemaps, amount of deleted Sitemaps, amount of imported Sitemaps, statistics on
										whether Web Scraper has been opened on respective day;
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										aggregated information regarding Sitemaps, including sitemap count, selector count, start
										web address count in Sitemaps, used selector types.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>When the User uses the Sitemap Wizard feature to create a sitemap, HTML of the active tab will be sent
							to Web Scraper to analyze the HTML with AI to generate data extraction selectors. To improve AI model
							the URL of the active tab will be stored in a database. The HTML is discarded immediately.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Scraped website data is not being collected.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							User created sitemaps are not collected.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h2>What Users can do regarding their Personal data processing</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							The User has the right to obtain information on what Personal data are at the disposal of Web
							Scraper and its developers in relation to the processing of Personal data of the User and to
							request access to his or her Personal data, correction, update or deletion of it, to limit the
							processing of Personal data, including the processing of Personal data carried out on the basis of
							the legitimate interests, as well as to exercise the right to Personal data portability, to the
							extent that we can provide it technically. We can only exercise rights of the User to the extent
							that does not conflict with the obligations imposed on us by regulatory enactments.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In the case of the processing of Personal data, where the legal basis is solely the User’s consent,
							the User has the right to withdraw the consent given at any time by suspending further processing of
							Personal data which has been carried out on the basis of the consent. Withdrawal of consent shall not
							result in the cessation of the processing carried out on other legal bases. The withdrawal of consent
							shall not affect processing carried out during the period of when the consent was valid.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							When we receive a request for the exercise of the rights of the User, we verify the identity of the
							User, evaluate the request and comply with it so far it is in accordance with regulatory enactments.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							We will send the reply to User’s request to the e-mail address of the User within 30 days from the
							time we received the request, or through postal services by signed-for mail. If it is necessary to
							clarify the information or to carry out more detailed research, the reply may require a longer
							period than 30 days, depending on the content of the request, but not more than 60 days.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In some cases, a request for the deletion of Personal data may not be implemented, for which the
							User is informed within 30 days from the time when the responsible person of Web Scraper has
							received a request for the deletion of Personal data. The answer is provided with clear, unequivocal
							justification for why the deletion of Personal data cannot be enforced. On the other hand, in the
							event of a reasoned request for the deletion of Personal data, we guarantee to accordingly delete
							User’s Personal data within 30 days of the date of receipt of the request from the User.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							In cases where we detect a breach of the processing or protection of Personal data or when a
							potential breach is rectified, we carry out an assessment of the impact of the infringement or
							potential infringement on the processing of Personal data to Web Scraper and/or the User. If
							necessary, we will inform the User of such violation or potential infringement and the National
							Data Inspectorate of the Republic of Latvia within 72 hours from the time of the detection of the
							violation or the moment when we became aware of a potential violation of the processing of Personal
							data. The User can at any time submit a request to us for the provision of information relating
							to any identified or potential breaches of the processing of their Personal data.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							If the User considers that the processing of their Personal data infringes their rights and
							interests in accordance with GDPR or other legal enactments, or that a serious infringement of the
							processing of Personal data of the User occurs, about which we have not reported to the User or
							the supervising authority, the User has the right to submit a complaint to Web Scraper, by writing
							to e-mail address:
							<a href="mailto:info@webscraper.io">info@webscraper.io</a>, or by addressing
							the National Data Inspectorate of the Republic of Latvia, address: Blaumana Street 11/13-11,
							Riga, LV-1011, Latvia, e-mail address:
							<a href="mailto:info@dvi.gov.lv">info@dvi.gov.lv</a>.
