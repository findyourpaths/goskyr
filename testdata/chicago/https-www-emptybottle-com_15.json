A longstanding member of Nine Inch Nails, Cortini has been releasing a steady stream of his own heady music on luminary labels including Mute and Important Records for the past decade. Balancing dark ambience with smokey, pulsing rhythms, his compositions are perfectly restrained, textured and mesmeric. In 2021, in collaboration with boutique synth builders Make Noise, Cortini released his own, custom designed, semi-modular synth, Strega (Italian for witch). That same year, he used Strega to build his latest full length, Scuro Chiaro (Mute), which Pitchfork described as pitched somewhere between purgatory and the planetarium [...] consistently managing to thrill and surprise. Throughout his shadowy rise to fame, Cortini has collaborated with the likes of Lawrence English, Daniel Avery and Merzbow (to name a few).",

On his latest album, When Im Calledhis first LP for Fat Possum, and his first as a parentFussell returns to a well of music that holds lifelong sentimental meaning, loosely contemplating the passage of time and the procession of lifes unexpected offerings. The album was produced by James Elkington and mixed by Tucker Martine. In addition to Elkington, it features the playing of Ben Whiteley (The Weather Station), Joe Westerlund (Bon Iver, Califone), and others. Blake Mills contributes guitars on several tracks. Joan Shelley and Robin Holcomb provide backing vocals. Fussell is the rare contemporary to approach folk in its pure form, shunning self-penned compositions about bummer relationships to concentrate on material handed down from bygone, hardened times. The New Yorker(Fussell) is one of the great magpies of American song, collecting forgotten, tarnished gems with a folklorists zeal his renditions arent so much cover versions as composites The Guardianmaybe the leading interpreter of American folk music right now.

Since then they have become one of the most influential underground bands of the past decade, creating a space for sophisticated pop music in the indie world.Their tendency to opt towards making straight-forward, stripped down and honest recordings lets their pop songwriting shine out in the open. With a heart firmly attached to their sleeves, their songcraft delves into the emotional intricacy of personal relationships, asking questions about power and desire. Riley Flecks measured drumming and David Carrieres trademark guitar licks mesh with Marta Cikojevics lush keyboards. All these elements work in tandem and in service of Jane Pennys unmistakable, wistful voice.The result of this mixture is a collection of four self-produced records and a handful of singles that cover a range of moods and a complex emotional realm while maintaining a groove and musicality. Soft rock infused pop hits flow easily, surrounded by their signature moody ballads",

    "field-2": "Doors: 8PM / Show: 9PM / 21+ Chris Cohen was always a quiet kid. In fact, this introversion was one reason he began playing music as a toddlerto communicate without speaking, to identify with others without the direct representation of words. It has worked, too, with Cohens terrific stint in the mighty Deerhoof and his own captivating art-rock act The Curtains preceding production and session work for the likes of Weyes Blood, Kurt Vile, Le Ren, and Marina Allen. Somewhere along that long way, Cohen started writing lyrics. He found that, though it didnt come naturally, the process offered a new sense of self-discovery and reckoning, a way to see himself and the world from unexpected angles. His three twilit albums of casually complicated pop during the last decade radiated these epiphanies: handling family strife, navigating advancing age, and understanding social woes. But Cohen has never had as much to sing so directly as he does on Paint a Room, his first album in five years and his debut for Hardly Art. If Cohens meanings have previously lurked inside the tessellated musical layers he built alone, they are newly clear and resonant here, animated and underscored for the first time by a band playing in real time. There is the endless miasma of state violence on the subversively melodious opener Damage, the existential exhaustion of modernity on the horn-traced jangle Laughing: this is Cohen communicating with friends not only through his deep understanding of groove, harmony, and hook but also with his listeners through songs that croon of our uneasy little era. In the past, Cohen made records in spells of isolation, phases when, as he puts it, he would try to make my world a lot smaller. He would play any of a dozen or so instruments until he stumbled upon something interesting, then slowly build upward and outward upon the idea. The method was solitary and stepwise, an act of accretion and deletion. Cohen, though, has been playing live with bassist Davin Givhan, drummer Josh da Costa, and keyboardist Jay Israelson in some fashion for the better part of a decade. This time around, then, he built demos in the dusty garage of the suburban Altadena rental that smelled like old wood and gasoline and tried something newhe took the songs on tour with that crew, yielding total control by letting them fill in or flourish their own parts as they saw fit. They came back home and began recording as a band. Cohen even called in a few friends to help, with Jeff Parker contributing the fluttering horn arrangement on Damage, and Parker collaborator Josh Johnson (who produced Meshell Ndegeocellos Grammy-Award-winning album The Omnichord Real Book) supplying flute, sax, and clarinet arrangements throughout the record. It felt a little bit like producing someone elses records, with Cohen given the chance to step back and evaluate others contributions to his own songs rather than scrutinize every little bit he made himself. This was a longtime ambition realized, another way of relating to others openly through sound.",

    "field-2": "Doors: 8PM / Show: 9PM / 21+FRANKIE COSMOS Several things happened before a warm day when I met the four members of Frankie Cosmos in a Brooklyn studio to begin making their album. Greta Kline spent a few years living with her family and writing a mere 100 songs, turning her empathy anywhere from the navel to the moon, rendering it all warm, close and reflexively humorous. In music, everyone loves a teen sensation, but Kline has never been more fascinating than now, a decade into being one of the most prolific songwriters of her generation. Shes lodged in my mind amongst authors, other observational alchemists like Rachel Cusk or Sheila Heti, but shes funnier, which is a charm endemic to musicians.Meanwhile Frankie Cosmos, a rare, dwindling democratic entity called a band, had been on pandemic hiatus with no idea if theyd continue. In the openness of that uncertainty they met up, planning to hang out and play music together for the first time in nearly 500 days. There, whittling down the multitude of music to work with, they created Inner World Peace, a collection of Gretas songs changed and sculpted by their time together. While Klines musical taste at the time was leaning toward aughts indie rock shed loved as a teenager, keyboardist Lauren Martin and drummer Luke Pyenson cite droning, meditation, repetition, clarity and intentionality, as well as 70s folk and pop as a reference for how they approached their parts. Bassist/guitarist Alex Bailey says that at the time he referred to it as their ambient or psych album. Somewhere between those textural elements and Klines penchant for concise pop, Inner World Peace finds its balance.",

    "field-2": "Doors: 8PM / Show: 9PM / 21+rinking Boys and Girls Choir (DBGC) are a three-piece punk band from Daegu, South Korea. Members consist of MJ on Drums, Meena on Bass, and Megan on Guitar. Inspired by Daegus 90s-00s hardcore punk/indie-rock scene before it moved to Seoul, the band have vowed not to move to the capital and prefer to nurture a sustainable local scene.In 2017, MJ suffered a serious motorbike accident, so the band took a hiatus while awaiting her recovery. When she was fit again, they DIY produced their 18 track debut album Keep Drinking, released on Damnably/Electric Muse in 2019, followed by show stealing appearances at SXSW, TGE, LSC, Pentaport, Busan International Rock Festival, Zandari \u0026 MU:CON and also toured the UK tour supporting label mates Otoboke Beaver \u0026 Say Sue Me.In February 2020 the band toured Europe with Otoboke Beaver just ahead of the pandemic shutting down the world. So, they wrote and recorded a new album and participated in several online editions of festivals. The bands sophomore album Marriage License was released in 2021, receiving acclaim and making best-of lists in the likes of Spin, Paste, MTV, Bandcamp, and gained radio play from KEXP andStrombos show on CBC in Canada. The album is a rallying cry in the fight for LGBTQ+ rights in conservative Daegu - this year the 15th Daegu Queer Culture Festival (DQCF) saw them perform, protected by 1,500 police from 450 homophobic government officials, for equality in marriage rights, and speaking out against sexual harassment and exploitation such as what occurred in the heinous Nth Room case.In 2023, the band joined labelmates Otoboke Beavers UK/Ireland shows and joined them again for their 2024 North American tour in February. They were live in session at KEXP studio in Seattle, after having previously recorded a KEXP at home session for the station in 2021. They released new single History and have just finished recording their third album for release later in the year.",

It can be anything you want. With recording The New Sound, it was the first time I have had no one to answer to. Being in a band (black midi), we often have this we can do everything feeling, but you are also kind of limited in that approach, and sometimes its good to do something else, to let go of things.Geordies debut solo album boasts a brand of high quality, all-embracing alternative pop fun not heard in a very long time, walking the line between the ridiculous and brilliant with a teflon-coated aplomb. How the record came about is a thing to marvel at. Over thirty session musicians were involved in its making, on two continents. Greep says, Half of the tracks were done in Brazil, with local musicians pulled together at the last minute. Theyd never heard anything Id done before, they were just interested in the demos Id made. The tracking was all done in one, maybe two days. The spirit of Greeps increasingly febrile and furtive soliloquies simultaneously calls to mind both Frank Zappa and Frank Sinatra, with a healthy dash of Scott Walker sprinkled throughout. The instrumental title track is a jazz-funk workout that could double as a soundtrack for a TV series or the intro music for a Broadway musical. Brass, wah-wah pedal and bass stabs, choruses and polyrhythms, all fizz and tumble around the place creating a sense of excitement and expectation. Tracks often oscillate from whispers to shouts, and start and end on a bang.The stories themselves act as a shopping list of the Active Male Imagination. A series of vignettes, where Geordie Greep plays the role of emcee and conductor. The characters we hear from are engaged in wild fantasies and situations in which they inevitably falter. The main theme of the record is desperation; someone who is kidding themselves that they have everything under control, but they dont. Here Greep gives color to a set of imaginings which include cannibalism, being boiled alive, and a woman giving birth to a goat. Street life is all around The New Sound: the listener is thrown into a world of cafes, bars, rented rooms, cabarets and strange museums. Here we see our heroes carry out a series of naughty assignments, military cosplay or socio-economic triumphs. The lines between parody and sermon are often blurred. The urbane romantic fantasy of single Holy Holy tells the story of an imaginary liaison in a nightclub, soundtracked by noughties indie chords and bravura Latin big band arrangements - including a three-piano attack.What next? My plan is to do a Keith Jarrett thing, have a different group of session musicians in a different place and lean into the fact that were not going to get it the same. How can anything ever be the same with Greep at the helm?",

It might still sound good and fans will probably lap it up, but the days of adventure and exploration are quite often long gone.Warmduscher are not most bands. Rather than closing up shop, on album number five the magical Too Cold To Hold they are most determinedly opening up. Taking on board the repetitive and polyrhythmic grooves of gqom (an alluring South African take on house music), adding in a dash of hip hop flavours and even jazz, and then harnessing that to their punk-funk, disco pogo, its a spellbinding mix that results in their best and most ambitious album to date. You could say they the wonderful 12-legged groove machine comprised of Clams Baker Jr., Benjamin Romans Hopcraft, Adam J. Harmer, Marley Mackey, Quinn Whalley, and Bleu Ottis Wright were, in fact, just getting started.",

They were called the lovechild of The Kills and The xx (IndieShuffle, US) with the raw grit of a Cat Power record (BestBefore, AUS) and a pinch of Ennio Morricone (FM4, AUT). Since their inception, Cari Cari have been tirelessly working to create their own world, carefully crafting everything from their music to their artwork, videos to set design in-house. This meticulous attention to detail has earned the band a loyal following; Rolling Stone Magazine called them the biggest discovery of Primavera Sound Festival, their die-hard fans sold out 1000+ capacity rooms across Europe and their debut album was praised by the likes of NME, KCRW, Rolling Stone, BBC Radio 1 and many more.However, for the band, all roads have led them to Kookoo Island. The product of years of world-building, the upcoming album Welcome To Kookoo Island, was born from a desire to retreat from modern-day life completely. Kookoo Island is our libertatia, the utopia of what we think the world should be like, explains Widmer. It seems to be cuckoo to dream of such a place right now, but dreaming of what we want the world to be like is the first step towards making it a reality, she continues.",
