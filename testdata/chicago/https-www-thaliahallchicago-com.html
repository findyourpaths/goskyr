A music video plays on a nearby loop on the Much Music TV channel. A man stands in a room, the background is nothing, non existent, as if in a void. The camera rolls and does not stop. He is shirtless. Sparse guitars begin as the camera sways effortlessly through the abyss, never taking its omnipotent gaze off the man. He is shirtless, cut from stone like a statue from antiquity. Flawless in all regards, but we have not seen everything yet.The music ungulates towards an apex as the camera begins to lower its gaze. Revealed are two lines few have seen before. Angular muscles beginning at the navel and ending at the thighs. A new style of music video is formed, a unique take of Rangelo is now truly whole.Peter sits at home transfixed to the screen. He is amazed as his perception of what is possible in music has changed. Peter is now on the precipice of a new dawn.Morning has broken. Wake up, grandma why dont you put on a little makeup. Or so he thought the lyrics went to the new music video playing. Chop Suey by System of a Down. Peter is flabbergasted again.More new styles of music, more new guitar riffs! He sits, mouth open, with a copy of Guitar World magazine open to the tablature of Chop Suey. Reading the fine print with a magnifying glass he is now completely stunned, knocked flat onto his back, when he learns a guitar can be tuned much lower than he had expected! Drop C in fact. A tuning he uses to this day.Time to go to school young man. This essay isnt going to read itself, he thinks to himself clutching his homework. At school a classmate of Peter reads his essay aloud for marks. They stumble through the quote Be careful when staring into the abyss because the abyss will stare back into you. After class, amazed at his friends penmanship, Peter does a secret handshake with the author to celebrate the success of the essay. A home-shake. That was the moment he Realized how to unite his new inspirations. An artist is born. -written by an interested third party<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

For Your Consideration, a follow-up to 2020s Im Your Empress Of and 2022s Save Me EP, is a bi-lingual album that embraces camp and fantasy playing with the idea of Hollywood. The songs, which veer between English and Spanish, reflect on the transactional nature of love and sex, which is mirrored by the ephemeral sense of existence in the entertainment industry. Empress Of has collaborated with Top 40 pop artists and cultural icons such as Khalid, Blood Orange, Lewis OfMan, DJ legend Boyz Noise, ShyGirl and Salute. Shes toured with the likes of Carly Rae Jepsen, Lizzo, Maggie Rogers, Rina Sawayama and wowed audiences at festivals such as Outside Lands and Corona Capital.

Check. Songs that are play-on-repeat heart punches? Check. Songs that are poetic and thought-provoking while also being absolute belt-at-the-top-of-your-voice-with-the-windows-down masterpieces? Check. Its all here.For the past 30 years, Nada Surf has had the same core lineup: Matthew Caws, DanielLorca, and Ira Elliot. Moon Mirror, their first for New West Records, was produced by theband and Ian Laughton at Rockfield Studios in Wales. For the recording, Matthew, Daniel, and Ira were joined by their friend and longtime keyboard player Louie Lino.Moon Mirror is a thrilling and moving leap forward for Nada Surf. The songs on the album are true to the human experienceas meaningful and mysterious and sometimes absurd as it is.Theres love, yes, but also grief, deep loneliness, doubt, wonder, and hope. These arenot the songs of a band in their 20s. There is hard-won wisdom here, and hard-won belief in possibilitythe kind that comes from falling down and getting back up.Give Me The Sun (Im looking for something/ I cant say exactly what), Second Skin(Im tired of living in this second skin/ I want to let everything in), and MoonMirror(connect me to something) grapple with being present and open, paying attention, and seeking connection in a world that feels alienating with its everything-all-at-once-ness.In Front of Me Now is a song against multi-tasking and sleepwalking through the one life we have. The song asks, Why wasnt I present? I could have been living, and shows us a transformation in the chorus: Today, I do whats in front of me now. I dont know about you, but I need this reminder as much as ever. Nada Surf has been working together for decades, and theyre consistently excellent, but they always surprise me. Thats what great art does. For nearly 30 years, Nada Surf has been a part of the soundtrack of my life. Our lives. I fell hard for the band over Let Go in 2002, and following that, The Weight Is a Gift, in 2005. Those songs are lodged in my body,someplace theyll never be extracted from. So are songs from The Proximity Effect, Lucky, The Stars Are Indifferent to Astronomy, and Never Not Together, which was my favorite record of 2020. Moon Mirror will take its place among the others, in heavy rotation.Four years ago, during lockdown, I was listening to Nada Surf one morning. My son, then seven years old, was quiet, and then he said, They sing a lot about love. What he said next has stuck with me: It protects you. Love protects you. If you need convincing, I think Moon Mirror will do just that. Lucky, lucky us to have had Nada Surfs music with us for all of these years, and lucky, lucky us to have these new songs now, right when we need them most.

She has regularly performed in concert halls around the world, but it was revelatory online performances, such as 2022s livestream from the prestigious Les Invalides in Paris, her live session from Studio 2 in Warsaw and Januarys compelling Tiny Desk Concert, that have brought her to wider attention. Theres a fascinating restless energy about Rani who switches constantly between piano and multiple synths with ease, often within the same song. Rani has proven equally adept at conjuring enigmatic classical compositions, sound installations, alternative pop, and won a number of awards for film scores. Her first two albums for Manchesters Gondwana Records, Esja and Home, established a template for blissful soundscapes and the latter was a Rough Trade album of the year, but her latest, Ghosts, sees another significant shift, with sweeping strings and her crystalline voice brought into the light.Mesmerizing... a suite of 13 tracks that take us on a musical and emotional journeyForbesOne of the most alluring records Ive heard in 2023Bob Boilen, NPREmbodying new, expansive tones, Rani didnt just perform.

Before he cut it, after all, he was a 20-year-old guitarist working at an ice cream shop in his mountain hometown of Asheville, North Carolina, getting away for self-booked tours of his own songs or with the band hed recently joined, Wednesday, whenever possible.But as the pandemic took hold just as he turned 21, Lendermanthen making more money through state unemployment than he had ever serving scoopsenjoyed the sudden luxury of free time. Every day, he would read, paint, and write; every night, he and his roommates, bandmates, and best friends would drink and jam in their catawampus rental home, singing whatever came to mind over their collective racket. Some of those lines stuck around the next morning, slowly becoming 2021s self-made Ghost of Your Guitar Solo and then 2022s Boat Songs, recorded in a proper studio for a grand. With its barbed little jokes, canny sports references, and gloriously ragged guitar solos, Boat Songs became one of that years biggest breakthroughs, a ramshackleset of charms and chuckles. Much the same happened for Wednesday. Suddenly, people were paying a lot of attention to what Jake Lenderman might make next.The answer is Manning Fireworks, recorded at Ashevilles Drop of Sun during multiple four-day stints whenever Lenderman had a break from the road. Coproducing it with pal and frequent collaborator Alex Farrar, Lenderman plays nearly every instrument here. It is not only his fourth full-length and studio debut for ANTI- but also a remarkable development in his story as an incredibly incisive singer-songwriter, whose propensity for humor always points to some uneasy, disorienting darkness. He wrote and made it with full awareness of the gaze Boat Songs had generated, how people now expected something great. Rather than wither, however, Lenderman used that pressure to ask himself what kind of musician he wanted to bethe funny cynic in the corner forever ready with a riposte or barbed bon mot, or one who could sort through his sea ofcultural jetsam and one-liners to say something real about himself and his world, to figure out how he fits into all this mess?He chose, of course, the latter. As a result, Manning Fireworks is an instant classic of an LP, his frank introspection and observation finding the intersection of wit and sadness and taking up residence there for 39 minutes. Yes, the punchlines are still here, as are the rusted-wire guitar solos that have made Lenderman a favorite for indie rock fans looking for an emerging guitar hero. (Speaking of solos, did you hear him leading his totally righteous band, the Wind, on his lauded live cassette last year? Wow.) But theres a new sincerity, too, as Lenderman lets listeners clearly see the world through his warped lens, perhaps for the first time. Please dont laugh, he deadpans during Joker Lips, a magnetic song about feeling pushed out by everyone else. Only half of what I said was a joke. Maybe you hear a tremble in his voice? Thats the frown behindthe mask, finally slipping from Lendermans face.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

(Full branding guide here.)Hinds, VIVA HINDSThe fourth album from Spanish indie rockers Hinds opens with a song called Hi, How Are You, and at the time they were writing it, best friends Carlotta Cosials and Ana Perrote wouldve responded: Not great Hey, you ok? Perrote sings to Cosials, who responds: Ive been better tbh. Its an apt introduction to VIVA HINDS, an album Cosials and Perrote made after emerging from a creative rut that began when they released their last album, Prettiest Curse, in 2020 and ended when their bassist and drummer decided to leave the band. In between, they split with their management team, lost touring revenue due to lockdowns, and were withouta label for the first time, but when Perrote and Cosials got together to write VIVA HINDS, those hardships dissolved.The girls had no one in their corner, but they had one another, and that mutual trust (they call themselves millionaires in friendship) allowed them to create the most accomplished album of their careers, one that celebrates their shared history and reaffirms that this band is in it for the long haul. Effervescent since inception, Hinds took off instantly over a decade ago when, after spending one too many nights out watching guy friends play guitar, Perrote and Cosials decided that they would learn the instrument, write songs, and start a band. Their scrappy ethic, infectious onstage personalities, and knack for writing hooks made their debut album, 2016s Leave Me Alone, a buzzy hit, and they kept the momentum going with I Dont Runin 2018. Since those formative early days, theyve toured internationally and graced festival stages at Glastonbury, Coachella, Fuji Rock, and many more, in addition to opening for major acts like The Strokes, Coldplay, and 5SOS.Through it all, they nurtured the intense bond that brought them together in the first place.We started the band because we are so safe and comfortable with each other. Our relationship is unbreakable, Cosials says. This connection between us hasnt changed since the very beginning. We still finish each others ideas, laugh at each others jokes and rhyme each others lines. Maintaining that enthusiasm for music and for Hinds through the years may seem extremely difficult to find, but its something that only can happen with your very best friend.Its been four years since Hinds released Prettiest Curse, the longest gap theyve taken between albums, and in that time frame, the girls tended the joyful spirit that made them want to start a band with help from a few critical collaborators and friends. Initially, the girls shared their demos with Sean Silverman (Beach Weather) on a trip to Los Angeles, who also showed them a pedal effect theyd never used before, one that would go on to influence the sonic landscape of VIVA HINDS.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Nash isnt finished shape-shifting just yet; in June, shell release her fifth album, 9 Sad Symphonies, under the legendary label Kill Rock Stars. Inspired by old Hollywood, vintage musicals and a desperate quest to find beauty in a rotten world, its another sonic shift following her rage-y recent output. Two things fueled that moment of the albums creation: her work on Only Gold, a musical Nash co-created, and a global pandemic that curtailed filming on the fourth season of GLOW and sent Nash and everyone into a tailspin. These melodic, bright-on-the-surface but deeply layered songs started to emerge out of creative scenarios that had been completely changed by the pandemic. On 9 Sad Symphonies, Nash has taken another huge step towards cementing her place as one of Britains most unique and fearless talents.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

After spending the past two years on the road and in the studio, The Heavy Heavy now draw listeners even deeper into their dreamworld with their long-awaited debut album One Of A Kind.Written entirely by co-founders Georgie Fuller and William Turner and mostly recorded at Turners studio in Brighton, One Of A Kind maintains the self-contained approach of Life and Life Onlya seven-song project acclaimed by outlets like NME (who named them an essential emerging artist for 2023) and The Guardian (who noted that The Heavy Heavy write and play music with that lick of madness that makes early Fleetwood Mac and peak Stones so thrilling). To that end, Turner produced, engineered, and mixed every track and handled most of the LPs lavish instrumentation (including guitar, bass, piano, organ, Mellotron, and more), with The Heavy Heavys live band lending their explosive energy to the album. But in a departure from the EP, One Of A Kind leans away from Laurel Canyon-esque folk-rock and fully embraces their British roots, finding a particularly crucial inspiration in the gritty and groove-heavy hedonism of the Rolling Stones Goats Head Soup. A lot of our EP was very bright and pretty, so we wanted to smash the door down like we do in the live show, says Turner. Because we were creating an entire album, there was so much more space to explore and expand, Fuller adds. Its still undoubtedly that Heavy Heavy sound, but now we have all these other rooms to play around in.For One Of A Kinds lead single, The Heavy Heavy chose a sun-drenched and sing-along-ready number that serves as an auspicious bridge to the bands new era. The last song written for the album, Happiness bends toward the lush psych-pop of Life and Life Only while introducing a new level of visceral intensity. We felt we needed a song that had that summery, flowery feel of the EP, and somehow at the last minute we were able to pull magic out of thin air, Fuller recalls. A fast fan favorite at their live shows, Happiness channels a bold determination to break free from loneliness and stagnation, ultimately providing an automatic mood lift thanks to The Heavy Heavys resplendent melodies and signature multi-part harmonies.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

In essence, this phenomenon occurs at the lowest of low moments and during the highest of high moments. MisterWives examine both ends of this spectrum in their music. The platinum-certified Los Angeles-based quintetMandy Lee [vocals], Etienne Bowler [drums, production], Marc Campbell [guitar], Mike Murphy [keyboards], and William Hehir [bass]absorb lifes ups and downs and recalibrate them in the form of snappy alternative rock anthems underlined by unexpectedly hip-shaking rhythms and identifiable tattoo-worthy lyrics.They meet everyone in the middle of these extremes on their fourth full-length offering, Nosebleeds [Resilient Little Records/Photo Finish Records].The title encompasses multiple meanings, Mandy notes. Theres the physical aspect of taking relentless punches and visibly showing the effects. Theres another aspect of being up high outside of the world. Were exploring all of these sides. I tried to be vulnerable and raw about my experience. As a kid, music was my escape and my safe space. At a really tumultuous time, I needed to write and feel excited about music once more. It was cathartic for what Id been through.The theme is fitting in terms of how we started, Etienne adds. We had no band or shows, but we had an excitement about making music and dreaming of what was going to happen. Not matter what stage youre at, this excitement helps you get to the next level.

It figures that a band with this abrasive, unrelenting, and outlandish of a sound has stuck as strong of a chord as it has. Dread has replaced the American dream, and Chat Piles music is a poignant reminder of that shift a portrait of an American rock band molded by a society defined by its cold and cruel power systems.Besides being the name of a largely forgotten (and panned) 90s film, Cool World makes for an apt title of Chat Piles sophomore full-length record. In the context of a Chat Pile record, the words are steeped in a grim double entendre that not only evokes imagery of a dying planet but a progression from the bands previous work, moving the scope of its depiction of modern malaise from just Gods country to the entirety of humankind. Cool World covers similar themes to our last album, except now exploded from a micro to macro scale, with thoughts specifically about disasters abroad, at home, and how they affect one another, says vocalist Raygun Busch.Though very much on-brand with Chat Piles signature flavor of cacophonous, sludgy noise rock, the bands shift to a global thematic focus on Cool World not only compliments the broader experimentations it employs with their songwriting but also how they dissect the albums core theme of violence. Melded into the bands twisted foundational sound are traces of other eclectic genre stylings, with examples of gazy, goth-tinged dirges to abrasive yet anthemic alt/indie-esque hooks and off-kilter metal grooves only scratching the surface of what can be heard in the albums ten tracks. While we wanted our follow-up to Gods Country to still capture the immediate, uncompromising essence of Chat Pile, we also knew that with Cool World, wed want to stretch the definition of our sound to reflect our tastes beyond just noise rock territory, reflects bassist Stin. Now that we had some form of creative comfort zones in place after hitting that milestone of putting out a full-length record, album #2 felt like the perfect opportunity to challenge those limits. Besides stylistically stretching the boundaries of the Chat Pile sound, Cool World is also the bands first record to have someone else handle mixing duties, with Ben Greenberg of Uniform (Algiers, Drab Majesty, Metz) capturing and further amplifying the quartets unmistakably outsider and folk-art edge.If I had to describe the album in one sentence, explains Busch, Its hard not to borrow from Voltaire, so I wont resist Cool World is about the price at which we eat sugar in America.Cool World will be released via The Flenser on October 11, 2024Chat Pile is:Raygun Busch - VocalsLuther Manhole - GuitarStin - BassCapn Ron - Drums<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Featuring a three-piece horn section, the groups music harkens back to earlier soul and funk influences while hinting at the jazz foundations that brought the bands members together. Along with singer and guitarist Tom Eddy, bassist MarkHunter and drummer Jarred Katz are equally at home in a tight-pocketed groove as they are spacious free-improvisation. Trumpet player Brennan Carter joined by saxophonists Evan Smith and Levi Gillis serve as the bands melodic counterpoint, playing off Eddys vocals to create adistinct sonic character that has drawn in millions of listeners to date.Love Direction, the follow-up to 2022s Sticking With It (which landed at #1 on the Billboard Current Rs fourth full-length studio album and second for Dualtone Records, due out 7/12/24. This new record is the sound of the band taking their next step forward. The interplay of old and new is on full display throughout the album; and, the group augments their classic sound with an expanded instrumentation throughout. Eddy says of the albums inspiration: As you get further along in a relationship, sometimes you lose your way. The things that came easily in the beginning get hard. The love is still there, its just that people and life are complicated. Sometimes you dont have the tools in the toolbox to figure out what you need to do to support the other person, so you have to get help and ask for directions.Still, despite the title, this latest record isnt a collection of straightforward love songs, but an investigation into the different angles and challenges that relationships can bring. Expanding on the albums theme, Eddy further notes These arent Love Songs in the most obvious sense. They deal with the middle stages, the hinterlands of love and life together - figuring someone out and what they need, learning how to communicate, and examining your own faults. We set out to write music that felt more grown, a little wiser. The songs that emerged all pointed in the Love Direction.Their last album cycle saw the band headline and sell-out shows at iconic venues across the country.

Featuring a three-piece horn section, the groups music harkens back to earlier soul and funk influences while hinting at the jazz foundations that brought the bands members together. Along with singer and guitarist Tom Eddy, bassist MarkHunter and drummer Jarred Katz are equally at home in a tight-pocketed groove as they are spacious free-improvisation. Trumpet player Brennan Carter joined by saxophonists Evan Smith and Levi Gillis serve as the bands melodic counterpoint, playing off Eddys vocals to create adistinct sonic character that has drawn in millions of listeners to date.Love Direction, the follow-up to 2022s Sticking With It (which landed at #1 on the Billboard Current Rs fourth full-length studio album and second for Dualtone Records, due out 7/12/24. This new record is the sound of the band taking their next step forward. The interplay of old and new is on full display throughout the album; and, the group augments their classic sound with an expanded instrumentation throughout. Eddy says of the albums inspiration: As you get further along in a relationship, sometimes you lose your way. The things that came easily in the beginning get hard. The love is still there, its just that people and life are complicated. Sometimes you dont have the tools in the toolbox to figure out what you need to do to support the other person, so you have to get help and ask for directions.Still, despite the title, this latest record isnt a collection of straightforward love songs, but an investigation into the different angles and challenges that relationships can bring. Expanding on the albums theme, Eddy further notes These arent Love Songs in the most obvious sense. They deal with the middle stages, the hinterlands of love and life together - figuring someone out and what they need, learning how to communicate, and examining your own faults. We set out to write music that felt more grown, a little wiser. The songs that emerged all pointed in the Love Direction.Their last album cycle saw the band headline and sell-out shows at iconic venues across the country. They have also had the opportunity to support new friends like Lake Street Dive and The Black Pumas, while also appearing at major festivals including Bonnaroo and Outside Lands. No strangers to the road, this new album represents a reflection on the bands touring gravitas as well as the promise of a new destination appearing on the horizon.

All of those ingredients find their way into her music, which pairs deft fingerpicking with lyrics that flirt with levity but hew toward introspection. Her first album I Need to Start a Garden saw release in 2018. Following years of heavy touring, Heynderickx has new music coming this year.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Necklaces bang against bare chests. And on their triumphant fifth album Poetry, Dehd transports us to a world steeped in imagery. Its a world painted in the sunset tones of summer romance and flickering old flames. Its motorcycle chrome (Mood Ring), its fake Gucci Sunglasses (Dog Days), and its shaking hands before a swaying lover (Hard to Love).Across fourteen songs, the trioJason Balla, Emily Kempf, and Eric McGradythrow themselves against the question of what it means to hope, knowing all too well that things end and hearts can break. You cant beat death, but you can beat death in life, wrote Charles Bukowski and upon listening to this album its obvious the band has chosen to attempt the latter. After hitting a stride with their 2020 breakout record Flower of Devotion, followed by their radiant Fat Possum debut Blue Skies in 2022, Dehd did something different. They turned a writing session into a road trip.With a van full of recording equipment they headed to Kempfs off-grid Earthship in New Mexico where they chopped wood to keep warm and worked for as long as the solar panels held a charge. They then traveled north to a borrowed cabin surrounded by the chilly waters of the Puget Sound, where the hours were marked only by the movement of the tide. On the way back to Chicago for their final writing session at the warehouse theyve called home for over a decade, Balla and McGrady became stranded for days in rural Montana after hitting a deer and abandoning their van. This tireless sense of adventure, both internal and external, has become a trademark of Dehd over the years. Eating, sleeping, breathingour only purpose was to write, Kempf recalled. And it seems in this place of quiet focus Dehd have achieved their most honest and vulnerable writing yet.In the studio they tapped Ziyad Asrar (of Whitney) to co-produce alongside Balla, marking their first time collaborating with someone outside of the band for the recording process. With the addition of Asrar the emotional landscape of the record is vividly rendered, at times confessional and others anthemic, vocals bared, up front with the confidence of a band that knows the power of their words.No one writes about love quite like Dehd, and on Poetry, they somehow make even heartbreak sound inviting. In the swirl of budding new relationships and lingering breakups, their lyrics find themselves at once exalting love and then turning to doubt it. Examining their own self-defeating habits. I let myself get in the way, turning every thought to jealousy, admits Balla on Light On, But was it worth losing a home?<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Inspired by his fathers love for the Spotnicks and their soaring guitar-driven sound, Daniel grew up hearing his father play their songs on his homemade guitar amp. This early exposure to music shaped Daniels own musical tastes and influenced his decision to become a musician himself.For Daniel, creating music for Arc De Soleil was more of a return to something very natural rather than being experimental. He draws on the vintage sound of The Spotnicks and the Shadows, as well as the funk rhythms of Asha Bhosle and contemporary acts like Khruangbin, to create a sound that is uniquely his own. With a focus on strong melodies and stringed instruments like the guitar and sitar, as well as infectious grooves and beats, Arc De Soleils music is both nostalgic and fresh.Being a diverse music maker, Daniel has created music in multiple genres, ranging from stripped-back acoustic to futuristic synthwave, and gained over 600 million streams and countless syncs across his different artist profiles. Arc De Soleil is one of these projects and one that lies close to his heart and creative passion.With a musical background in playing live shows, Daniel has been a supporting act for Paramore, Tegan and Sarah and Explosions in the Sky, to name a few, and is about to go on tour with Paramore drummer Zac Farros solo project Halfnoise later this year. Daniel also has an extensive experience in songwriting, production and mixing, having worked with Taylor York (Paramore), Mike Daly (Ryan Adams, Plain White Ts), Evan Frankfort (The 100, Rancid), Evan Taubenfeldt (Avril Lavigne), Zac Farro (Paramore, Halfnoise), Veronica Maggio, Miriam Bryant among others.Whether working on his own compositions or collaborating with other artists, Daniel brings a passion and dedication to his music that is evident in every note. With Arc De Soleil, he has created a musical project that is as captivating as it is personal.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Doubt is quite dark lyrically, but it is found in this upbeat and almost campy environment.On Yard, the Wisconsin-bred, Chicago-based four-piece nestles comfortably into pockets of nuance, impressions, contradictions sonics and lyrics finessed together to bottle the specific tension of a feeling youve never quite been able to find the right words for. In that regard, listening to Slow Pulp can feel like being in a room with someone whos known you so long that they can read your every micro-expression and pinpoint exactly how youre feeling before you can. Perhaps this spawns from the bands own shared history and chemistry; in various ways, the four of them grew up are still growing up together.Guitarist Henry Stoehr and drummer Teddy Mathews attended elementary school together in Madison. Not long after, they met bassist Alex Leeds at the west side location of the now-closed local music program called GoodnLoud Music. And while Massey didnt enter the fold until later on in college at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with Mathews and Stoehr, it turns out she was in the same program on the other side of town at GoodnLouds east side location. In fact, the chords to Yards addictive track Slugs are from a song Stoehr wrote for his crush in the sixth grade. Imagination, Mathews immediately chimes in with the name of Stoehrs original. The albums iteration of the song is, fittingly, also about a crush: Youre a summer hit, Im singing it, Massey swoons over a warm wave of guitar fuzz and syrupy background vocals.With Leeds attending college in Minneapolis and the other members in Madison, the quartet started recording, playing shows around the Midwest, and eventually released their first EP as a four-piece, EP2, in 2017. Its an intimate, restless, and decidedly lo-fi 17-minute debut by a band with an obvious knack for creating sticky hooks that tend to stay in the space behind your eyes long after the songs are finished playing. So obvious that, without much promotion on the bands end, EP2 picked up traction across YouTube channels and blogs, and thanks to the power of the internet, Slow Pulp unexpectedly found themselves amid their first wave of buzz.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

The sessions with Walla (Death Cab for Cutie, Tegan and Sara, Foxing) struck the perfect balance between preparation and experimentation, injecting new life into the bands style of soft-hearted Midwestern indie rock with an ever so subtle Americana twist. The solidified Ratboys lineup stretched and expanded their vision in the studio, adding unexpected elements and instruments like rototoms, talkboxes, and fiddles. The result is Ratboys most sonically diverse record, shifting wildly from track to track. It flexes everything from fuzzy power pop choruses on Crossed That Line and Its Alive! to a warm country twang on Morning Zoo to mournful folk on the titular track. After more than ten years and four studio albums, The Window finally captures Ratboys as they were always meant to be heardexpansive while still intimate, audacious while still tenderthe sound of four friends operating as a single, cohesive unit.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Like any other sentient being, it consumes, evolves, and transforms from one season to the next.Its shape may change though its spirit remains the same. Founded and fronted by Manuel Gagneux, it has only sharpened its claws, lengthened its teeth, and steeled its nerves over the years, growing more undeniable and unpredictable in the process.After gathering tens of millions of streams and earning widespread critical acclaim, this beast proves as dynamic and dangerous as ever on its fourth full-length album, GREIF.Zeal Manuel observes.Its definitely a restless organism that I have the privilege of raising.Hes done a hell of a job raising it so far...In 2017, Zeal near perfection in a 4.5-out-of-5 star review, while The Line of Best of Fithailed, Zeal The band graced the cover of KERRANG!, while the record landed high in the charts in multiple countries globally.However, Manuel decided to switch up the process for GREIF. Rather than creatively fly solo, he welcomed his bandmates into the studio. As such, the musiciansTiziano Volante [guitar], Marc Obrist [vocals], Denis Wagner [vocals], Lukas Kurmann [bass], and Marco Von Allmen [drums]spread their wings alongside him.The guys basically gave this project seven years of their lives on tour, so it felt odd to be the only one on the albums,he says.The sound is more of an analog to what we do on stage. You get the same idiots, just on vinyl, he laughs.Weve really evolved into a tight-knit unit,adds Marc.Before Zeal re like a little family now. Each member brings his own unique flavor to the mix, and we all try to make Manuels songs better in our own way. The most interesting part for me was the new approach of how we work together in the studio.Decamping to Marcs studio Hutch Sounds in Switzerland, the record came to life in just five months.The frontman excitedly leveraged the talents of his cohorts, featuring three voices for the first time and emboldening the sound from every angle. I wanted to expand upon what we had and introduce new colors, he goes on.There are angry and accusatory moments, but theres also some solace and happiness. Im widening the palette of colors we have to paint with. These are avenues we havent tried.Tiziano concurs, This album feels like a warm homecoming into a place of uncertainty. What could be described as the start of an other era artistically is probably more of a coming to life of a bigger beast in the form of a more communicative and better organized collective.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Their unique approach of combining moving orchestral arrangements and shoegaze guitar noise is held in extremely high regard; so much so, that the bands unique musicianship and diverse musical palette have eclipsed the Rock genre and exist within their own realm. As British Musical Magazine NME once stated, this is music for the Gods.Over the first decade, MONO rapidly established a well-acclaimed status, especially with their live performances. Through their annual world tour consisting of around 150 shows, visiting now over 60 countries, both critics and fans of Rock music agree their sheer euphoric, dynamic resonance of performance makes MONO one of the best live bands in existence.A particularly monumental early live memory was a special set of 10th anniversary shows, held with an orchestra, in New York, Tokyo, London and Melbourne; which was later immortalised as the live album Holy Ground. MONO now proudly holds the title of being one of the most internationally successful bands in Japan. For the respective anniversary show in Tokyo, they also had the pleasure of collaborating with NHK Symphony Orchestra master Fuminori Shinozaki.Outside of the studio and live music, MONO has also made its name as a film score composer. After releasing 10 successful albums including a live album with an orchestra, the band received the highly regarded award The Marshall Hawkins Awards: Best Musical Score - Featurette from the Idyllwild International Festival of Cinema for their collaborative short film Where We Begin in 2015, and the band was also nominated for Ariel Award for Best Original Music Score for the feature film The 4th Company which was released in 2016. In addition, the band handled the music for such media work as the feature film All Gods Children Can Dance written by Haruki Murakami, the original TV drama Kanata No Ko by Japans leading broadcasting network WOWOW, the feature film Real Onigokko written and directed by Sion Sono, and more.In 2018, MONO began a new journey. After welcoming the new drummer Dahm, the band started to prepare for their second decades celebration and during this time, they received a special invitation to be one of the headliners of Londons Meltdown Festival, personally requested by the 2018s curator Robert Smith of The Cure; an unforgettable gesture and honour for the band, from one of the bands long-time inspirations. The stage was then shared with artists such as My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails, Mogwai and Deftones.The bands 20th anniversary was welcomed the following year. To commemorate this occasion, the 10th album Nowhere Now Here was released alongside a year-long world tour, consisting of 4 special orchestra shows in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and London, ending in March 2020. One of the orchestra shows, held at the historic Barbican Hall in London, performed to a rapt sold-out audience of 2,000, was once again immortalised as a live album Beyond the Past which charted at #2 on Billboards Classical Crossover Albums in the US.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

True to its charmed complexity, the singer/songwriter/pianists second full-length came to life over the course of a tumultuous year spent living in a possibly haunted church in Chicago. The result: a portrait of profound upheaval and weary resilience, presented in a kaleidoscopic sound thats endlessly absorbing.The follow-up to Franciss 2019 debut Changesa New Orleans-Rthe reincarnation of Allen Toussaint by BBC Radio 6In Plain Sight was written and recorded almost entirely at the church, a now-defunct congregation called St. Peters UCC. Despite not identifying as religious, Francis took a music-ministry job at the church in 2017 at the suggestion of a friend. After breaking up with his longtime girlfriend while on tour in fall 2019, he returned to his hometown and found himself with no place to stay, then headed to St. Peters and asked to move into the parsonage. I thought Id only stay a few months but it turned into over a year, and I knew I had to do something to take advantage of this miraculous gift of a situation, he says.Mixed by Grammy Award-winner Dave Fridmann (HAIM, Spoon, The Flaming Lips, Tame Impala), In Plain Sight finds Francis again joining forces with Changes producer and analog obsessive Sergio Rios (a guitarist/engineer known for his work with CeeLo Green and Alicia Keys). Like its predecessor, the album spotlights Franciss refined yet free-spirited performance on piano, an instrument he took up at the age of four. From a very early age, I was playing late into the night in a very stream-of-consciousness kind of way, he says, naming everything from ragtime to gospel soul to The Who among his formative influences. With a prodigy-like gift for piano, Francis sat in with a dozen different blues acts in Chicago clubs as a teenager, and helmed a widely beloved instrumental funk band called The Heard before going solo. Along with earning lavish acclaim (including a glowing review from Bob Lefsetz, who declared: THIS IS THE FUTURE OF THE MUSIC BUSINESS!), Changes led to such triumphs as performing live on KCRWs Morning Becomes Eclectic, sharing the stage with members of The Meters at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, and touring with such acts as Lee Fields &amp; The Expressions and Black Pumas.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

This is my 19th record and I feel like Im just hitting my stride.Slow Burn is a new high point in a remarkable career that now spans more than three decades and includes a long list of accolades; four GRAMMY nominations, three NAACP Image Award nominations, a Soul Train Award for Best Jazz Album and four RIAA Gold Record certifications. In 2009, Billboard named James one of the Top 3 Contemporary Jazz Artists of the decade. In 2024 year Boney became the first ever artist to score 20 number one singles on the Billboard Smooth Jazz chart.Slow Burn follows two of the most successful albums of James career, 2020s Solid and 2022s Detour which debuted in the Top 10 on the Billboard Pop Albums Chart.James is, of course, thrilled that his music continues to reach new audiences more than thirty years after he released his debut album, Trust, in 1992. Its always been my goal to be one of those guys that would just keep doing it at a high level, he says, and to have that connection with the audience.Thats what its always been about for Boney James. Growing up in New Rochelle, New York, James played clarinet in his school band, but two years later, he says, The teacher needed a sax player. As soon as I switched, playing it became my favorite thing to do.By the time he entered his teens, James was already gigging with bands, and he turned pro at 19. After years of paying his dues with artists like The Isley Brothers, Teena Marie and many more, Boney cut his first album on an independent label, which led immediately to a major label deal and a string of increasingly successful recordings and nonstop touring.Now residing in Los Angeles with wife, director Lily Mariye, James says, I wake up each day and try to play a little better. To quote the cellist Pablo Casals I think Im making progress. I am really proud of my playing on this new record. And I absolutely love the songs and the sound I achieved.Some might say it has a Slow Burn: a deliberate intensity.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

This record spans a lot of my life its about having a really deep desire for connection, but also encountering all the obstacles that stood in my way to be able to achieve that, patterns of isolation or even boredom with the real work of love they say.Written over the course of seven years, What A Relief comprises a set of songs that Gavin always loved but which had something in them that she and her bandmates felt didnt quite fit within the universe they were trying to cultivate with MUNA. Many of them were written on acoustic guitar, and are rooted in a style of music thats very much in my blood, and natural for me, as typified by the Women &amp; Songs CDs that Gavin loves, which compiled music by artists like Tracy Chapman, Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan.That openness of spirit is the overwhelming character of What A Relief, an album thats refreshing in its willingness to accept people as they come, even as it remains in dogged pursuit of a life thats kinder, wiser and more loving. Gavins explorations of desire and intimacy feel time-worn and necessary songs that might teach a generation if not how to live, exactly, then at least how to look within oneself for guidance about how to move forward.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Their self-titled debut album was released by International Anthem in 2019. Wide acclaim for Resavoir included Pitchfork, who called it a complex, soulful album that celebrates interconnectedness, VICE, who called it lush and lovely, and Best of 2019 lists by NPR Music, Bandcamp, and BBC 6 Musics Gilles Peterson. In late 2019, Resavoir performed at the first Boiler Room Festival in London. During that trip, they recorded a cover of the Charles Tolliver song Plight at legendary London jazz hub, Total Refreshment Centre, which would later be released on the Blue Note Records compilation Transmissions from Total Refreshment Centre. In November 2023, Resavoir released their second self-titled album on International Anthem; and in December Miller debuted revamped versions of the live ensemble for performances at Londons Church of Sound, Brooklyns Pioneer Works, and Knoxvilles Big Ears Festival. The year 2024 sees Resavoir releasing a few loosie remixes and singles, followed by their first European tour in November, and culminating in the largest live iteration of the band yet Orchestra Resavoir which will debut at Chicagos Thalia Hall in December.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

He is a sweet and pleasant individual, a bit of a shy nerd during the daytime, but when he puts on his uniform the infamous Windows95 shirt and denim hotpants combo and gets on the stage in the evenings, he transforms into a superman!Dubbed Finlands most entertaining DJ, Windows95man has toured extensively throughout Finland in recent years, also making appearances overseas in places like Japan, a Finnair flight, and Tenerife. His sets, consisting of 90s eurodance, techno hits and unexpected surprises, have combined with such intense live performances that the audiences have been left breathless. Keisteris endeavors and sometimes quiteunique artistic content are followed globally.After years of waiting, the fans of Windows95man finally got what they have long been craving. His debut single - 90s eurodance inspired fast tempo pop song No Rules! has everything you could hope for in a complete self-esteem-boosting party-hard-and-dance-your-heart-out banger. No Rules! got its world premiere in the final of UMK, the biggest and most appreciated music contest in Finland. The stunningly joyful supershow made of Teemu Keisteris Maximum No Rules attitude, Henri Piispanens unbelievable vocals and the mythical denim egg lead the duo to unexpected but indisputablevictory and to represent Finland in Eurovision 2024 Song Contest. Windows95Mans unforgettably iconic Eurovision performance was noted widely around the world and got the artist featured in Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, Graham Norton Show, NME, Vogue Scandinavia, NBC and BBC just to mention few.No Rules is a guideline that Keisteri has followed throughout his whole artistic career and adult life. Its a simple phrase that commands you to forget how one should dress, look, love, or behave, according to the norms set by society.

Soon after, they formed Rubblebucket, using the project to delve into pop, funk, dance and psychedelia; performances have spanned Bonnaroo to Glastonbury to their self-curated Dream Picnic Festival, and theyve collaborated with kindred genre-blenders including Arcade Fire and Scissor Sisters Jake Shears. Their latest full-length LP Year of the Banana is perhaps their deepest and grooviest work yet.

Almost all the songs started out as poems, says Margolin of the work that became Clouds In The Sky They Will Always Be There For Me (2024), I wanted to challenge myself. In songwriting, Dana argues, she had learnt that the writer can always hide behind the tricks of the music and well-worn techniques such as repetition. In a poem, though, says Dana, you cant hide. Recorded in the Somerset countryside in early 2024 by longtime Big Thief and Laura Marling engineer Dom Monks, Clouds In The Sky They Will Always Be There For Me is Porridge Radios new album and first new music in two years. The UK bands new album is a coming-of-age moment inspired by burnout, the music industry, heartbreak and the brutal collapse of significant relationships and - crucially - Danas own increasing immersion in her craft as an artist. Across the album, particularly on the devastating A Hole In the Ground and God Of Everything Else, Danas ruthlessly self-interrogating writing style is matched by some of the bands most affecting music to date, patiently building and tragically intense. When Porridge Radio formed in 2014 - a decade ago - being in a band was the very last thing that London-born Dana Margolin expected to do. Studying anthropology at the University of Sussex, Dana began performing her songs on her own at local open mic nights, before assembling a full band - taking in Georgie Stott on keyboards and backing vocals, Sam Yardley on drums and keyboards, and former bassist Maddie Ryall (who departed in 2023, replaced by Dan Hutchins). Their debut album - Rice, Pasta and Other Fillers (2016) was followed by Every Bad (2020), which was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize and acclaimed by The Guardian as uncompromisingly brilliant. Later, Waterslide, Diving Board, Ladder to the Sky (2022) became their first UK Top 40 Album Chart success. Today, Dana reflects on Clouds In The Sky They Will Always Be There For Me with the enthusiasm of a real creative breakthrough. It feels like the first time weve made something, she explains, it captured something about our friendship as a band and the way that we have learnt to play together. I love the songs, I love playing them, they havent gotten old to me and it feels like its a very singular thing. A pause. Its taught me so much. Following your gut to the nth point, trusting your friends and their loyalty, trusting yourself to be able to fight with people properly and still come back together. How I want to live is how I want to make records, because making records is my life because my work is my play is my job is my life. It all ties together in this thing, and there are ways to do this that might not kill me.

While the multi-hyphenate comedian andsongwriter was on tour in 2022his first time performing his own material with a full band every nighthe noticed a recurring response to his lyrics among his devoted fanbase. Especially people my age, maybe a little younger, he recalls, They would come up to me and say, That is how I feel. And its nice to know you feel that way, tooWhere his celebrated work in film and television is often an act of complex, surrealistworldbuilding, the increasingly tender and expertly crafted singer-songwriter material that Heidecker releases under his own name is built to encourage these person-to-person connections. After the breakthroughs of 2020s wistfully lush Fear of Death, made in collaboration with Weyes Blood, and 2022s High School, whose multidimensional tales of nostalgia were never quite as distant as they seemed, Heidecker has reached a new peak with Slipping Away, his warmest, fullest, and most ambitious record to date.I guess you could say all my records are concept albums to some degree, Heidecker notes. This one, however, tells a story on a larger scale, offering an imagistic framework that allows for some of his brightest melodies, heaviest themes, and most direct and vulnerable lyrics. Theres a feeling of before the fall and after, he explains of the albums two-part arc. Things are going well until theyre not. I wanted to write some stories about that experience.Working with his seasoned touring band, Heidecker wrote a series of songs that tap intouniversal anxieties, familiar settings, and, occasionally, a blast of apocalyptic unease. If he were to perform them solo acoustic, they might sound like folk songs, with their instantly hummable melodies, singalong choruses, and unexpected ability to zoom out far beyond their initial premises. On Slipping Away, a father-daughter trip to a ballgame might spiral into a reflection on the random lottery of fame; a walk into town can induce a nightmarish vision of a world without people and the lifelong struggle between man and society. Even the simple act of making music, as portrayed in the cleverly constructed writers block anthem Wells Running Dry, can lead to an earnest reflection on insecurity and aging. As soon as I wrote that, I worried that its not cool to talk about, Heidecker says. But a second later, I thoughtwell thats challenging and exciting. Lets push past that.Part of the excitement comes from the electrified, lived-in sound of Heideckers band: Eliana Athayde on bass and vocals; Josh Adams on drums; Vic Berger on keys; and Connor Catfish Gallaher on guitar and pedal steel. While the songs consistently deal with crises of confidence and community, Heidecker refers to Slipping Away as a true group project, a euphoric experience that helped turn his songs into living, breathing things. My favorite records are the ones that were just recorded in a room with a band playing, he says, citing classic-rock landmarks from Bob Dylan, The Beatles, and The Band. And thats what we did.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Allison has used Soccer Mommys songs as a vehicle to sort through the thoughts and encounters that inevitably come with the reality of growing up. After all, Soccer Mommy began as a bedroom-to-Bandcamp exercise with teenage Allison posting her plaintive songs as demos. Over the years, though, she has often enhanced that sound, using the endless production possibilities, newly at her fingertips, to outstrip singer-songwriter stereotypes. The records would start with songwritings kernels of truth, and she would then imagine all the unexpected shapes they could take. Every Soccer Mommy record has felt like a surprise. On Soccer Mommys fourth album, the tender but resolute Evergreen, Allison is again writing about her life. But that lifes different these days: Since making her previous album, 2022s Sometimes, Forever, Allison experienced a profound and also very personal loss. New songs emerged from that change, unflinching and sometimes even funny reflections on what she was feeling. (Speaking of funny, this is a Soccer Mommy album, so theres an ode to Allisons purple-haired wife in the game Stardew Valley, too.) These songs were, once again, Allisons way to sort through life, to ground herself. She wanted them to sound that way, too, to feel as true to the demosraw and relatable, unvarnished and honestas possible. The songwriting would again lead where the production would follow.

I went through a few years where I wasnt able to writeI tried therapy, I read books on writers block, I went on writing trips, but nothing was helping, says Israel Nebeker, frontman for the Oregon-bred band. After stepping back and reimagining his songwriting approach, Nebeker challenged himself to write an entire album in a month, then brought those songs to his bandmates with a newfound sense of receptivity. I told myself that whatever songs came through in that month would be for the love of the band and music we make together, says Nebeker. Instead of being controlling in the studio, I wanted to let the songs live and breathe with the band as an entity. By the time we finished, it was the most joy wed ever had in making an album together.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

Originally incorporated into the Norwegian kingdom in the medieval period, the Faroese have found themselves subject to foreign rule for over 1000 years. Today, the country is a semi-autonomous part of the Danish kingdom, but it has had its own government since 1948. Eivr is strongly inspired by the Faroese natural scenery and traditional culture. It is a land of extremes, full of contrasts, with heavy, dark winters, and bright, joyful summers. Growing up in a small village among the characteristic steep cliffs and grassy hills, Eivr is deeply inspired by the unique Faroese landscape and its vibrant traditional folk music. Despite centuries of foreign rule, the Faroese folk culture has persevered, especially through communal singing and dancing. This cultural resilience in the face of a harsh nature andforeign dominance strongly informs Eivrs music: A very strong part of Faroese culture is singing togetheranywhere people gather, there will be singing, Eivr explains. When you listen to old Faroese traditional music, its sung acapella and takes you back to its Renaissance roots. Its pure, expressive, and untamed.Eivr has cultivated her distinct guttural singing technique under inspiration from beatboxing, throat-singing, and heavy metal growling to convey the untamed expressiveness inherent to traditional Faroese music and culture. It is a primal call to return to her roots in natural landscape of her birthplace.Often considered to be one of the most prolific and unique Nordic artists of her generation, Eivr has released 11 studio albums to date, crossing musical genres and always pushing the bounds of the expected. Awarded with the Nordic Council Music Price in 2021, Eivrs musical journey continues to fascinate.After independently releasing her music for many years, ENN marks Eivrs debut for the metal label Season of Mistand though her compositions sit outside of any one genre, she is happy to be embraced by the metal community. She identified a shared pagan sensibility in her television scores like The Last Kingdom. I never felt I really fit into any box, said Eivr. I just have to do it my own way. Recorded with her touring band in the Faroe Islandswhere she now lives again, splitting time between her homeland and DenmarkEivr called ENN my most pleasurable and also most painful process. I felt that I was stepping into a place where I hadnt been before, and thats always scary because you dont feel that you touch the ground. But it opens up your creativity and takes you to someplace new. Its woven together all my experiences for the past 10 years, and its grounded me.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

After releasing a highly successful independent EP at age 20, Broussard made his major-label debut with Carencro. The album featured the breakout hit single Home and catapulted him into the national spotlight. The Louisiana-born and raised artist has created a wide range of music in his career. Carencro laid the groundwork with unequaled style, illustrating his knack for modern soul music and setting the stage for his long and distinguished career. That album and the others that followed solidified Broussard as a southern soul singer with a rarefied talent and an innate stylistic and emotional authenticity that have made him one of the most indelible artists of his generation. NPR cited, His music radiates soulful Louisiana blues, but his songs blend those influences with raucous rock n roll to create unique and infectious music.Over the past decade, Broussard released several notable albums with major labels and has since returned to his independent roots with a series of critically acclaimed original and philanthropic cover albums through his S.O.S Foundation (Save our Soul). Marc has accumulated millions of streams and hundreds of millions of views on viral YouTube videos.Broussards incomparable brand of soul, an infectious mix of rock, blues, Rs charitable foundation.Marc Broussards new studio album, Time is a Thief finds the acclaimed singer/songwriter delivering an infectious ten-song set filled with gritty, rootsy hooks and dance-floor grooves, all wrapped around Broussards fervent vocals. Produced by Grammy-winning guitarist/songwriter/producer Eric Krasno and Grammy-nominated producer/guitarist Jeremy Most, Time Is a Thief has a funky, soulful sound and is wonderfully layered with diverse sonic textures that distinguish it from his previous recordings.

Like heat returning to numb fingertips, life felt like it was taking shape again after a long period of personal trauma. With a diaphanous sheath of lyrics in mind, she went to Bergen, Norway to work on new music. On the three days of the year that it didnt rain in Europes wettest city, among the silvery lakes and mountain peaks, life grew ever brighter. the warmth was formed.I ate up all the light, it shone through my teeth, I tasted sunbeams emanating from me... it cant hurt me... now the warmth is returning, she sings in unfurling harmonies, spectral with full-bodied pop, a determined percussive march building like a personal artillery.This emotional arc would be core to Paris Palomas debut album, cacophony.The Derbyshire-born musician gave the world labour in 2023. It was the first song shed ever fully recorded in a proper studio early releases like narcissus in 2020, 2021 EP cemeteries and socials, and 2023s notre dame were produced in her own bedroom or others. But early clips she posted with stolen lyrics of labour to TikTok had already garnered a curious audience. Its journal-like lyricism and incisive strain of compelling, dark folk-pop skewered the knots of womens emotional labour, and it immediately became a rallying cry worldwide upon official release. The track broke over 100 million streams on Spotify, cracked the Official UK Singles Chart and US Billboard Chart, and soundtracked tens of thousands of TikToks. It spurred on sold-out shows around the UK, and Paris, armed with a compact slew of songs, travelled to the US and Australia for the festival circuit. I matured because of labour, Paris explains. As a young artist youre both protected and limited youre putting songs that areso intimate into a void. Its made me more considerate about how vulnerable these songs are going to be.Such vulnerability can be difficult to confront, and all the more to articulate as art, but I feel very held by my listeners, Paris says. This symbiotic care between artist and listener is innate within Pariss devoted fanbase. Shes cultivated a community both online and off: on TikTok, her 400K followers send her videos (of thoughts, song snippets, and tour moments) into six-figure views. Fan-made art and videos analysing her lyrics span social media. Shes also crowdsourced the voices of hundreds of fans for a new version of labour to be released. These are roots laid deep, as Paris gains wider recognition from NME to Billboard, as YouTubes Trending Artist on the Rise and a Breakthrough Artist to Watch 2024 by Amazon.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

With a career spanning over half a century, Taylors influence on African music is undeniable, from his early days with highlife bands like the Stargazers to collaborations with Afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti. Taylors innovative blend of traditional Ghanaian music with jazz, funk, and Afrobeat creates a signature sound showcased in albums like Ebo Taylor and Tower Nyame. Experience the evolution of Taylors musical journey, from his pioneering horn arrangements to his timeless classics like Heaven, as he takes the audience on a soul-stirring exploration of African rhythms andmelodies. This special evening celebrates Taylors enduring legacy and contributions to the global music scene, promising an unforgettable fusion of sounds and cultures.Ebo Taylor BioBorn in 1936, Ghanaian guitarist, composer, arranger, bandleader, and producer Ebo Taylor has been a vital presence in African music for more than half-a-century. During the early 60s, he was active in the influential highlife bands the Stargazers and the Broadway Dance Band whose singles were mainstays on national radio. In 1962 he took his Black Star Highlife Band to London and collaborated with other African musicians who were also in Britain at the time, including Fela Kuti. Back in Ghana, he worked as an influential producer, crafting recordings for Pat Thomas (his future collaborator) and C.K. Mann, among many others. During the 70s, his own musical projects combined traditional Ghanaian music with Afro-beat, jazz, and funk, creating a trademark sound asevidenced by the albums Ebo Taylor the Pelikans (1976) and Twer Nyame (1978). In the 80s, albums such as Conflict Nkru! and Hitsville Re-Visited (co-billed to Thomas) by his Uhuru-Yenzu band delivered a rawer, more immediate sound. Over the next two decades, Taylor was a noted producer, arranger, and composer, workingwith Thomas, Mann, Gyedu-Blay Ambolley , Kofi Yankson, and dozens of others. He returned to performing live in the early 21st century after hip-hop producers began sampling his work. Soundways Records released the compilation Ghana Special. In 2010, Strut Records released Love and Death, his first internationally distributed album, followed by a series of catalog reissues and all-new recordings including 2018s Yen Ara.Pat Thomas BioPat Thomas is a Ghanaian vocalist and songwriter famed for his work in the highlife bands of Ebo Taylor and his own recordings of Afrobeat and Afro-pop.Born in Agona, in the Ashanti region, Thomas had music almost literally in his DNA, his father was a music theory instructor and his mother a bandleader. In the 1970s, he moved to Accra to join Ebo Taylors legendary highlife band The Blue Monks; their residency at the Tip Toe Night Club is an important part of modern Ghanaian culturalhistory. In the later years he moved to the Ivory Coast and produced various records in Afro-beat, Afro-Latin sounds and reggae melded to funky African disco.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.

The music cant speak for itself. But after 22 records, why cant Ani DiFrancos work speak for itself? Yes, her forthcoming album is shaped by stories ones about reproductive freedom, the double-edged sword of the pandemic, identity and ever-evolving belief systems that have shaped each of its 11 songs. There are songs that were written in 2011 and in 2022; some for musicals, others for childrens books. The album isnt linear, but it is inherently teeming with DiFrancos spirit. It was paramount to the folk-feminist hero that listeners not be saddled with preconceived notions while diving into her 23rd album Unprecedented Sh!t. I believe there is a rhyme and a reason as to why these songs have come together in this way now and I want people to experience this album as a journey, a piece of art, without being influenced by a cacophony of surrounding narratives.While many of DiFrancos albums were made more insularly, shes opened herself up to collaboration in recent years. For 21 of DiFrancos 22 albums, she opted to self-produce. With Unprecedented Sh!t, she wanted to try working with a producer and tapped BJ Burton, who produced one of her favorite albums, Bon Ivers 22, A Million. With Burtons help, largely from afar, they created soundscapes often using only DiFrancos voice and guitar as the raw materials and manipulating them with effects and filters. I really wanted to lean into the power of machines in a way that I never have before, so BJ and I communicating through many layers of them in order to collaborate, seemed apropos. This record was made almost entirely by me and BJ alone, bouncing things back and forth.The title Unprecedented Sh!t is not only representative of how much of a sonic departure the 11-track album is from Anis other work, but also a political and social commentary on the current state of the world. We find ourselves in unprecedented times in many ways, faced with unprecedented challenges. So, our responses to them and our discourse around them, need to rise to that level.DiFranco has been known as a feminist icon and pioneer of DIY for nearly 35 years. Since founding her record label Righteous Babe Records in 1990, she has released 22 albums, traversing folk, punk, hip-hop, soul and electronic genres and addressing a range of autobiographical, political and social issues. While her first four albums Ani DiFranco (1990), Not So Soft (1991), and Imperfectly (1992), Puddle Dive (1993), harnessed a more raw sound, Out Of Range (1994), Not A Pretty Girl (1995) and Dilate (1996) were more rooted in DiFrancos folk ethos. She released eight more albums over the next 10 years, earning a Grammy Award for her 2003 album Evolve and numerous nominations. Her most recent albums include 2008s Red Letter Year and 2017s Binary.

Using his formidable voice, looping pedals, and his vast imagination, Watts blends and blurs the lines between music and comedy, wowing audiences with performances that are 100% improvised. He was recently the DJ at the 2021 Emmy Awards, which saw a 15% ratings boost from 2020. Watts first Netflix special Spatial released to massive critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it a giddy rush of escapist nonsense and dubbing Watts the most influential absurdist in comedy today. The A.V. Club described Spatial as signature Watts, meaning its alternately exhilarating, silly, exhausting and transcendent, and Exclaim! Magazine called his performance engaging, absurd, thoughtful and, most importantly, wholly unpredictable. As a solo performer, Watts brand of musical/comedy fusion has led to sold out headlining tours in the U.S. and Europe, including festivals such as Bonnaroo, SXSW, Bumbershoot, Just For Laughs, Pemberton and more. In 2020, Watts released his own content app called, WattsApp, a techno-savvy look into his life, work, and techno junk drawer. WattsApp has all original content including a showcalled, Droneversations where he interviews guests while its filmed by drones along with other fun content. In 2010, Watts released his debut comedy special, Why Shit So Crazy? on Comedy Central Records, and is now available to stream on Netflix. Why Shit So Crazy?featured Watts in live performances at New York venues such as Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and Le Poisson Rouge, bookended with brief sketches and music videos. Later that year, at the invitation of Jack White, Watts recorded Reggie Watts: Live at Third Man Records which was released in limited edition vinyl. In 2012, Watts recorded his second comedy special, Reggie Watts: A Live At Central Park, which was released by Comedy Central. Reggies memoir, Great Falls, MT will be published on October 17 th 2023 by Penguins highly curated Tiny Reparations imprint. Watts was born in Germany, raised in Montana, and currently resides in Los Angeles.<br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr=""><br role="presentation" data-uw-rm-sr="">This event is 17 and over.
