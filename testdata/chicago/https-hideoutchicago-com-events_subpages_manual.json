Their unique harmonization of female voices, sonically levitating vibraphone, warm purring amps, and shimmering banjo have earned them comparisons to artists ranging from Wilco, Fleetwood Mac and Kate Bush, to Big Thief, Waxahatchee, and Kevin Morby.\nThroughout their career, they’ve recorded with luminaries such as Peter J. Moore (Cowboy Junkies’ Trinity Sessions) and Chicago Post-Rock pioneer John McEntire (Tortoise, Stereolab) and have shared the stage with the Sea \u0026 Cake, Widowspeak, The Sadies and Shannon Shaw. \nTheir new album Requiem for a Planet, Recorded by Kevin S. McMahon (Swans, Real Estate, Titus Andronicus) at Marcata Recording—a 200-year-old barn at the base of the Shawangunk mountains in New Paltz, NY— is a world unto itself. Described succinctly as “a hike along Grief Mountain with scenic lookouts,” Requiem stakes out new sonic territory for the band, while still thematically exploring both the darkness and light of the places we find ourselves.\nMaria Elena Silva\nSilva released Eros (ft Jeff Parker) in 2021 on BIG EGO Records with producer Chris Schlarb. Her sophomore album, Dulce, was released in 2023 as a BIG EGO and Astral Spirits co-release. Dulce features avant-pop guitar legend Marc Ribot, and Silva’s long-time drummer Scott Dean Taylor. Silva’s music lives in suspension: percolating and swirling with energy and detail, with a delicacy and fluid sense of time throughout. Lyrically, she manages to be both otherworldly and confessional. Silva’s guitar provides a concise, elegant skeleton expertly fleshed out by the band.\n \nRAYS\nA group of Chicago music scenesters, RAYS finds Skyler Rowe (vibraphone), Jake Acosta (guitar), Andrew Scott Young (bass), and Brian J Sulpizio (drums) in familiar company but unfamiliar territory. Exploring Young’s original music alongside the 1970’s outputs of folks like John Scofield and Chick Corea, one finds the musicians—all of whom have played together with the likes of Ryley Walker, Health\u0026Beauty, Famous Laughs, Mute Duo, and more—finding new ways to communicate while grappling with music that is both familiar and foreign, near and far, personal and impartial. The quartet weaves a special world in its approach to this music; one that is definitely worth a visit.\n\n \n$15 ADV // $15 DOS plus fees\n· 21+· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

Finding that they shared similar frustrations about the emerging brass band scene in the city, co-founders Alex Harris and Ally Chapel came together to form a group dedicated to showcasing the talents of female musicians in a landscape that was dominated by male musicians and bandleaders.\nAfter debuting in March 2019, Brass Queens grew to be a fixture in the New York music scene and was even dubbed “the hardest working band in town” by their peers. The Queens gained a dedicated following through busking on the streets of Brooklyn and playing pop-up events in tight-knit communities. Even the pandemic couldn’t slow them down, as the band found ways to still bring music and joy to their fans during quarantine. Since then, Brass Queens has gone on to play iconic venues like Blue Note Jazz Club and Brooklyn Bowl, as well as major events like The Met Gala, Governor’s Ball Music Festival, Exit Zero Jazz Festival, Good Morning America, and more.\nBrass Queens has developed a signature sound that sits right at the intersection of the Big Apple and the Big Easy: their music is deeply inspired by and pays homage to the New Orleans brass band tradition while injecting the upbeat, multifaceted energy of their New York home into each performance. The result is a nonstop party: a Brass Queens show will have you singing along to classic pop hits, dancing your heart out to reggaeton, and feeling like you’ve been transported to Frenchman Street. In February 2021, Brass Queens released their debut EP Royal Street on all streaming platforms, and on October 27, 2023 they released their first full-length album titled Black \u0026 Gold.\nBlack Bear Combo\nFire breathing horns, thunderous drums, serpentine melodies, and crooked rhythms issue forth from this skeleton crew of a brass band. Black Bear Combo channels the common energy between street music of the Balkans and elsewhere with various strains of rock and jazz. Since 2002 we’ve brought our sound to bars, basements, festivals, weddings, funerals, parties and street corners across the country.\n$15 ADV/ $18 DOS plus fees\n·  21+· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.\n· Standing room only, for accomodations email manager@hideoutchicago.com\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Not Available Online    \n        \n            RSVP"

Donning the moniker C3zR, Pinos project combines his background as a classically trained and jazz pianist with the electronic funk or soul of his favorite artists like Kaytranada, Daft Punk, Robert Glasper. Anyone could find themselves in the world Pino creates in his electronically produced but soulful debut album, ‘Round Voyage.’ When enlisting Rax Tracks’ Noam Wallenberg (The Oh Mys, Woody Goss of Vulfpeck, REVERB) for mixing and mastering, Pino brought other local guests to contribute to the album, ranging from Chicago singers Ifeanyi Elswith and Travis Percy, Jamal Damien on trumpet, and guitarist Paolo Apuli. Round Voyage off of 600 Block Records fulfills Pino’s vision to create a record full of ear-worms while also tracing Chicago’s musical history of soul, funk, disco, and house.\nPugs Atomz:\n \nDesigner, muralist. rapper, and radio host Pugs Atomz is a true hip-hop renaissance man. He has been able to tour the world performing his deep catalog, solo and with frequent collaborator DJ Vadim (The Electric, UK). His inspiration for all this stems from growing up in Englewood, where he would witness the performers on the Green Line train and see the murals and graffiti art in his neighborhood. Hip Hop Culture has always been his battery, so it was no surprise when he started a collective called The Nacrobats, in the mid 90’s. From that point, he began releasing albums from the collective and mixtapes frequently. By throwing parties and concerts at The Blvd Art Center and The Point Field House, Pugs solidified himself in the hip-hop scene including Open Mike Eagle, Psalm One, and more. \n \nSarita Songbird:\n \nSarita Songbird is a soulful mixture of intellect and passion. She boasts a rich, melodic narrative deeply rooted in love, feminism and empowerment. A Chicago based musician-her profound and ambitious sound bears bold influences in acoustic soul, alternative R\u0026B, and pop. Born into a biracial household, Sarita embodies musical influences from her Latin and African American cultures. Her musical tapestry pays homage to her Puerto Rican culture with lyrics in English and Spanish. Adding to her unique magic is her mellifluous and soulful voice. Her resonant and warm vocal tones, paired with lyrics grounded in human emotion and deeply personal experiences are sure to captivate a room.\n \nImperial Boxmen:\nInitially focused on recreating the songs sampled in 90’s hip hop, Imperial Boxmen grew their sound to original music under the direction of keyboardist Kevin Ford. Their sound sits firmly in the jazz underground of Chicago, drawing influences from instrumental hip-hop, 70s jazz-funk, and currents of afrobeat and ethiopiques music. Ford’s experience songwriting — working and performing with the late Fela Kuti drummer, Tony Allen and Chicago Afrobeat Project — and his work as an electronic music producer and downtempo DJ are all major influences on their sound. \n\n \n$12 ADV/ $15 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

His 2023 self-released album Funny Blue intuitively blends synthesizers, field recordings, and samples to create ethereal atmospheres with a folktronica lean.\nSwim Ignorant Fire\n \nThe upcoming full-length album by the unique trio comprising Yea Big on gamelan bells and bass clarinet, Nate Hahn (Ohtis) on pedal steel, and Holliger on sp202 sampler, bass, and synths promises to elevate their musical journey to new levels. The album’s first half carries forward the signature style of the trio, blending downtempo psychedelic Polynesian tropical loops with ambient cosmic country. This fusion creates a vibe that is perfect for basking in the sun, with hints of Hawaiian jazz that could even inspire Uncle Steve to embark on a boating adventure. Truly groovy in places but the party ends eventually around the half mark like morning fog being burnt away by an early sun. Overall, the album promises a mesmerizing journey, brimming with lush ambience, textural soundscapes, and a fusion of diverse musical elements that showcase the trio’s artistic depth and creativity.\nStretchMetal is a Chicago-based nonprofit resource network, label, and concert series promoting emerging artists in the ever-evolving landscape of abstract sound.  \n \n\n$15 ADV/ $18 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming."

With Alex Post on lead guitar, Miles MacDiarmid on drums, and Dylan Allard on bass the band is “A whirlwind of biting critique, nervy post-punk guitars, and absurdist humor.” Pitchfork describes them as “spirited punk primitivism with two-minute art-rock tracks—punchy, melodic songs united by nervy guitars and cutting takedowns of modern frustrations.” Despite the global pandemic’s impact on live music, Fake Fruit have still managed to turn heads, touring the U.S. and overseas playing shows with Alvvays, Dry Cleaning, Amyl and the Sniffers, The Descendants, Cate Le Bon etc. and earning accolades from the likes of Bandcamp, Pitchfork, Brooklyn Vegan, Post-Trash, and more. With funny but biting lyrics, blistering guitars, and a powerhouse rhythm section you’ll feel in on whatever joke they happen to be telling.\nRui Gabriel\n$15 ADV/ $17 DOS plus fees\n·  21+· Door staff will check ID.· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets    \n        \n            RSVP"

A kind soul that’s just a touch world-weary, McKelvie’s careful economy of language belies a sly sense of humor set against a backdrop of unadorned instrumentation.\nThematically, the record strikes the perfect balance between serious musing and whimsy. With his band of in-the-pocket players at his side, McKelvie has crafted a record that is equally at home in the listening room as on the dance floor. Eminently engaging and full of nuance, A New Kind of Hatis a record destined for a treasured spot in your collection.\nJake McKelvie has been writing songs and performing them since his teens. With his band The Countertops he’s released three full length records and toured relentlessly to support them. His last proper solo effort was 2016’s Rhinestone Busboy.\nThis time around, McKelvie has decided to file the new record in the “solo project” bin. “The Countertops are known for energetic live shows and goofy stage behavior, whereas as a solo act I do more of the folk singer thing” he explains. “This new record floats somewhere in between those two things.”\nWritten over the years in myriad apartments and tour vans throughout the northeast and beyond, McKelvie turned to Grain Thief’s Mike Harmon and his studio Wachusett Recording to track the record. In addition to McKelvie, the record features appearances by Michael Holland on bass, and Countertops drummer Matt Bacon. Keith Dusoe makes a cameo on pedal steel. It was mixed by Harmon and Roger Lavallee.\nThere’s a lot here if you really listen — but you can just as well hum and tap along.\nMint Mile \nMINT MILE is an experimental rock band from Chicago.\nAdvance Base\n\nMelancholic electronic story songs made by Owen Ashworth in his basement.\n \n$12 ADV/ $15 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

With a large catalog of songs both loud and quiet, hard-hitting and sensitive, dancey yet contemplative, Jim The Kid thrives in experimentation and self-exploration. Joined on stage by The Painkillers, his live show is one that’s filled with dancing and high-energy performances played from the heart to give the audience a night they won’t forget. Jim The Kid \u0026 The Painkillers are Jimmy Clarke on guitar and vocals, Victor Kamhazi on guitar, synthesizers and backup vocals, Tommy Nelson on bass, and Ranan Vales on drums.\n \nThompson Springs\nThompson Springs is the project of Chicagoan Matt Smith. His hazy songwriting, which PBS called “western rock,” and love of the unknown, has led the band down a circuitous route across Europe, New Zealand, and the expanse of America. Detroit Public Radio (WDET) noted that they pull influences from classic songwriters, like Tom Petty, to more recent indie artists, like Kurt Vile. Thompson Springs started working with Kurt Vile collaborator Rob Laakso as well as Wilco’s Pat Sansone for their debut album, Undertones, which they released on Dropped Beauty Recordings in 2020. 2023 will bring a new album, Standby, produced by Pat Keen of Humbird, and recorded live, featuring the full 6 piece band and the debut of harmonica player Ryan Suzuka\n \nSaint Malboro\nSt. Marlboro is a Chicago rock ‘n’ roll band influenced by twangy classic country, ethereal indie rock, and thegrit of Chicago punk. The four-piece band creates a unique urban-gothic sound, reminiscent of early 2000’sfolk-rock powerhouses. This backdrop serves as the vehicle for singer-songwriter Kyle Paulin’s straightforwardstorytelling, complimented by melancholy Americana undertones. They have performed throughout Chicagoand the Midwest, supporting acts such as Left Lane Cruiser, Lucky Tubb, The Goddamn Gallows, RailwayGamblers, and J.R.C.G., and have made their presence known in the Chicago club circuit at venues likeSchubas, Empty Bottle, Subterranean, and Reggie’s Rock Club. Their live show is a high-energy, yet intimateexperience, featuring a spectrum of sounds ranging from delicate to scathing.\n \n$15 ADV/ $15 DOS plus fees\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

A virtuoso on multiple instruments including piano, drums, bass, guitar, and synths, Julius’s early exposure to late-night jam sessions and collaborations with seasoned musicians shaped his versatile musical style. His ability to seamlessly blend jazz with elements of funk, soul, hip-hop, and electronic music sets him apart as a modern-day innovator in the genre.\nThroughout his career, Julius has collaborated with a diverse range of artists, spanning from jazz legends like Wynton Marsalis to contemporary icons such as A$AP Rocky. His contributions to Meshell Ndegeocello’s Grammy-winning album “The Omnichord Real Book” highlight his adaptability and creativity in merging different musical influences. In 2024, Julius released his second album, “EVERGREEN,” on Verve Records, marking a significant evolution in his sound. This album showcases Julius’s ability to blend traditional jazz elements with modern production techniques and a wide spectrum of musical influences. Tracks like “Mission Statement,” which combines hyperpop and drum ‘n’ bass with jazz improvisation, and “Stars Talk,” featuring Nate Mercereau’s atmospheric synths, demonstrate Julius’s capacity to push musical boundaries while maintaining a cohesive artistic identity.\nBeyond his studio recordings, Julius is celebrated for his electrifying live performances, characterized by virtuosity, improvisational skill, and a deep connection with his audience. His move from New York to Los Angeles in 2022 provided new inspiration and opportunities for creative exploration, influencing his collaborative work with producer Tim Anderson. Julius’s commitment to music education and mentorship further underscores his impact on the next generation of musicians, cementing his role as both a performer and a guiding force in the world of contemporary jazz.\nAnaiet Soul\nAnaiet is a contemporary artist whose music is heavily influenced by Jazz, Gospel, Neo-Soul, RnB and Folk music. Their music is inspired by the stories of all of our lives and the belief that the human experience is one worth heavily documenting. She seeks to encapsulate these experiences in a medium that has proven to withstand the test of time. Piano, Guitar and Voice have been their creature comforts and have sustained their interest and curiosity throughout their music career. They’ve been a dedicated student of music for about 15 years, studying many iterations of Classical Piano, Jazz, Gospel, Rnb, Blues, Rock and most recently Folk; which they believe have all impacted the lyricism,processes, and performance of their art. \n$17 ADV/ $20 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming."

I see a boy with a singular vision and a hell of a lot to learn. \n\nThey say you have your whole life to make your first record and 18 months to make your second. Although Ledges isn’t technically my first album, for all intents and purposes, it feels like it. It was the one I spent years writing. Some songs were written on a mattress on the floor of a rented room I shared with a friend, in a run down old house I moved into when I left my folks place at 17. Some I wrote in my first apartment in Seattle. One was written in the early hours of the morning, waking up on a friends couch to a simple, beautiful piano arrangement Abby wrote. One, after the unexpected heroin overdose that resulted in the death of a friend. Another, after briefly reigniting an old flame, only to watch it quickly burn out. \n\nEverything was new back then. The colors were brighter, the highs higher, the lows lower. Falling in love felt like the first time. Heartbreak felt like the end of the world. Ideas felt important and the future was a big, empty canvas.\n\nThere’s a lot of self importance in all of this and ultimately this is just some record that some kid made. But to that kid this record felt like his whole world. And like all records, it’s a little snapshot in time. And how lucky we are to have snapshots, photographs of moments and memories that ground us in the reality we’ve lived.Noah GundersenIt’s a strange thing to have a living artifact of your younger self. To observe the manifestations of a younger you’s inner life. To be honest, it’s often cringy and anxiety inducing. With the benefit of hindsight, our shortsightedness and misplaced fears and hopes seem so obvious. \nLEDGES 10TH ANNIVERSARY VIP EXPERIENCE\n\n\nOne General Admission ticket\n\n\nPre-show acoustic performance (requests allowed!)\n\n\nOpportunity for Q\u0026A with Noah\n\n\nAutographed setlist\n\n\nExclusive tour poster, signed by Noah\n\n\nCommemorative VIP laminate\n\n\nEarly entry to the venue\n\n\n$27 ADV/ $30 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

To observe the manifestations of a younger you’s inner life. To be honest, it’s often cringy and anxiety inducing. With the benefit of hindsight, our shortsightedness and misplaced fears and hopes seem so obvious. \nAs I look back, ten years later, to the person I was when I made Ledges, I see a young man full of ambition and naivety, desperate for validation and a sense of belonging. I see a boy with a singular vision and a hell of a lot to learn. \n\nThey say you have your whole life to make your first record and 18 months to make your second. Although Ledges isn’t technically my first album, for all intents and purposes, it feels like it. It was the one I spent years writing. Some songs were written on a mattress on the floor of a rented room I shared with a friend, in a run down old house I moved into when I left my folks place at 17. Some I wrote in my first apartment in Seattle. One was written in the early hours of the morning, waking up on a friends couch to a simple, beautiful piano arrangement Abby wrote. One, after the unexpected heroin overdose that resulted in the death of a friend. Another, after briefly reigniting an old flame, only to watch it quickly burn out. \n\nEverything was new back then. The colors were brighter, the highs higher, the lows lower. Falling in love felt like the first time. Heartbreak felt like the end of the world. Ideas felt important and the future was a big, empty canvas.\n\nThere’s a lot of self importance in all of this and ultimately this is just some record that some kid made. But to that kid this record felt like his whole world. And like all records, it’s a little snapshot in time. And how lucky we are to have snapshots, photographs of moments and memories that ground us in the reality we’ve lived.\nLEDGES 10TH ANNIVERSARY VIP EXPERIENCE\n\n\nOne General Admission ticket\n\n\nPre-show acoustic performance (requests allowed!)\n\n\nOpportunity for Q\u0026A with Noah\n\n\nAutographed setlist\n\n\nExclusive tour poster, signed by Noah\n\n\nCommemorative VIP laminate\n\n\nEarly entry to the venue\n\n\n$27 ADV/ $30 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

The idea was to form a band, perform in NYC, get written up in New York Rocker and disband. Curtis Crowe heard them practicing from upstairs and brought his drums downstairs to the mix. Former classmate Vanessa Briscoe Hay was recruited to audition on February 14, 1979 after several other art school friends didn’t work out.\nTwo weeks later, they performed their first show above the local record shop Chapter Three Records. Shortly after this, the B-52’s caught them at a party out in the country. Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider thought that Pylon should go to NYC and helped by personally taking Pylon’s tapes around to clubs . Their help resulted in a gig opening for the Gang of Four at Hurrah. Instead of New York Rocker. they were written up in Interview Magazine by music critic Glenn O’Brien. What followed was a Cinderella story of sorts. Instead of disbanding, they decided to keep at it as long as it was fun. Along the way, Pylon opened for bands like Talking Heads, PIL, The B-52s and toured throughout the US, Canada and the UK. They also recorded two albums and three singles for Atlanta label DB Recs.\nPylon Reenactment Society\nMore than a tribute band, Pylon Reenactment Society have written new songs with Pylon as their guiding star. PRS have delighted old Pylon fans while making new ones. PRS features original Pylon vocalist Vanessa Briscoe Hay, guitarist Jason NeSmith, bassist Kay Stanton and drummer Gregory Sanders.\nPRS was formed in 2014 to play a few Pylon songs for a one-off show as part of an arts retrospective exhibit named Art Rocks Athens – appropriate as the members of Pylon were all art majors at UGA. Vanessa decided to call the project Pylon Reenactment Society – an inside joke among the original band when they were relearning their material in the early 2000s. The Art Rocks show was enthusiastically received. Encouraged, and with the surviving Pylon members’ blessings, Pylon Reenactment Society became a real band. \nAzita\nAfter blowing up the 90s/early 00s with The Scissor Girls and Bride of No No, AZITA took an an aught-rageous turn: piano– woman singer-songwriter with a chopstastic band and a pocket full of scabarous pop tunes! Six albums in, AZITA shows no sign of quitting – and we show no sign of ever wanting her to.\nira glass\n$15 ADV/ $18 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming.\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

He has played over 2000 shows in more than 25 countries. His songs have been recorded and/or performed by REM, Luna, Concrete Blonde, The Black Crowes, Yo La Tengo and Eleventh Dream Day, among others; his “That’s Why I Wear Black” became the #1 single of 1993 in Norway as the leadoff track from the debut album by Somebody’s Darling. He has been prominently featured in Rolling Stone, Mojo, Uncut, Entertainment Weekly, People, The Los Angeles Times, New York Times and countless other publications all over the world.\nOr maybe you know Wynn from his groundbreaking work with The Dream Syndicate, a band that–along with REM and the Replacements–practically invented the American indie rock scene of the 1980s. Perhaps you know Wynn from his critically acclaimed solo albums of the 1990s which were fixtures on many Modern Rock radio stations across the country. Or it could be from his highly touted side-project Gutterball which by its fifth gig found itself signed to Mute/Elektra and on a national tour with The Black Crowes. Or maybe from his recent “Desert Trilogy” and the near-legendary shows with his current backing band The Miracle 3. Or maybe you tuned in for the first time when he played on the Late Show With David Letterman as part of The Baseball Project earlier this year.\n“What he took from punk had more to do with attitude, noisy energy, abyss-skirting emotions and musical riskiness–qualities, of course, present in the best rock and roll of any scene, era or sub-genre” – Trouser Press Music Guide\nSteve Wynn was born in Santa Monica, California in 1960 and got his first guitar (a nylon-string acoustic) when he was nine, shortly after which he wrote his first song “Sing My Blues”. He formed his first band “The Light Bulbs” that same year and the band made the circuit of parties and school functions; the band’s oldest member was ten years old. By the time he was 13, Wynn had played in bands with such colorful names as Purple Passion and Sudden Death Overtime, alternating between his own early originals and songs by Neil Young, The Rolling Stones and The Who.\nThe excitement and immediacy of the punk rock explosion of 1977 brought him back into the world of songwriting and performing. He found himself writing and playing guitar for UC Davis (near Sacramento) New Wave pioneers “Suspects”, a band for whom Wynn wrote over 100 songs, none of which he has performed since. A move back to Los Angeles with Suspects lead singer Kendra Smith was the first step towards the formation of The Dream Syndicate, the band with whom Wynn would gain national and eventually international acclaim.\nThe Dream Syndicate played together for the first time in December 1981 and within three weeks had recorded its self-titled first EP. The record was released in April 1982 and followed six months later by the band’s debut album “The Days of Wine and Roses“, an album which fans and critics alike still consider one of the best and most important rock albums of all time.\nRick Rizzo \n$20 ADV/ $25 DOS plus fees\n·  21+· Door staff will check ID.· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.\n\n\n\n\n                                \n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                            \n                     \n                \n            \n            \n                    \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        \n                    \n                \n                \n                            \n                    \n                        Buy Tickets"

This grassroots approach finds the band at their most relaxed and precise, paradoxically sounding their most country yet, as they explore their hometown’s musical landscape and address its rapid changes. Songwriter and guitarist Shane Perry’s clever lyrics, delivered with a mix of sensitivity and deadpan humor, complement the band’s signature blend of saccharine harmonies, hypnotic riffs, and earnest ballads, resulting in a fresh take on classic 70s rock. Inspired by Harry Nillsson’s “I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City,” the album envisions ‘city life’ as a call for a better world, valuing care over productivity and community over profiteering. The title track, originally about Perry’s brother moving to Chicago, evolved into a broader theme of rebirth and the personal and societal shifts involved. The album blends stories both real and imagined, such as “The Day Dale Died,” inspired by a flea market encounter, and “James Harvey,” influenced by high school sports rivalries. The addition of co-producer and drummer Peter Brooks brings a jazz-tinged style that complements Jared Hicks’ solid rock drumming, while each band member’s influences, from Sam Silva’s Bon Scott-era AC/DC riffs to Neil Young’s haunting folk ballads, are woven into a cohesive sound. The album’s themes of personal and collective discovery resonate through Perry’s lyrics, such as in “Horse in Heart,” celebrating the universal inner wilderness everyone possesses. City Life reflects The Medium’s commitment to exploring new musical paths and understanding the world around them through their enduring friendships and evolving sound.\nForest Ray\nSeattle based folk n’ roll band, Forest Ray, has been described as “spaced-out, down to earth, Brit-pop gone country” that sounds like “the band covering Beatles songs no one knew existed”. Their songs regularly explore diverse instrumentation, which have become staples of the group’s brand of rock n’ roll. Through a consistent touring and recording schedule, they have become one of Seattle’s most known active bands. Their sixth studio album, Windfucker (Jebivjetar), was released in January 2024. They have since followed up with a US and Canada tour and a second tour of Europe promoting the LP and are now ending with a final 2024 tour for the record in the United States.\nPOWERPUP\nBorn out of necessity, Chicago-based POWERPUP formed in 2016 with an unapologetic embrace of the full-spectrum experience of youth. With a playful curiosity through lyrical storytelling, these Pups offer up their melodic breed of pop with a tenacity that’s sure to draw you into the groove.\n$15 ADV/ $15 DOS plus fees\n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming."

Her music draws heavily from the legacy of folk storytellers and is shaded with theperspective of city life. Winefred RT’s observational storytelling often captures themelancholy of relationships alongside the quiet beauty of everyday moments. \n \nHer forthcoming acoustic EP Moving captures this ethos, reflecting a journey through heartbreak, growth, and finding comfort in transience. Raised in Milwaukee and steeped in the Midwest’s vibrant indie scene, Winefred RT’s music resonates with listeners seeking emotional depth and relatability. You might like to listen to Winefred RT in the backseat of a car, your forehead on the chilled glass, watching the raindrops roll down the window.\n \nLawrence Tome \n\nLawrence Tome (which is the name of the band and pseudonym for the singer). They take a lot of cues from Chet Atkins-era Nashville Sound, with a penchant for Beatles-Esque hooks, a decent use of space in composition, and a lack of constraint by traditional instrumentation. They may perform with a flute player one night and a steel player the next night for the same set, making each perform special (I got to be that pedal steel player once! For a band with such complex arrangements, there was plenty of room for ad libbing and improv I should add). There’s also as much heart in some songs as there is humor (take for example, their ballad “Swamp Thing” which is a western ballad for the Swamp Thing).\n\n\nRussell Walker\n \nSongwriter Russell Walker is a soulful country artist from Kentucky, half at home on the piano and sometimes from the dance floor. Chicago was a critical chapter in his writing and life and although he’s in Tennessee he works to spread the Honky Tonk tradition just like he learned it, a musical family telling stories and walking the floor.\n$12 ADV/ $15 DOS plus fees \n· 21+\n· Door staff will check ID.\n· Tickets are non-refundable and non-exchangeable, please review your order carefully before confirming."
