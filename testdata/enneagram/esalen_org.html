Today the word “Tantra” has an incredible array of culturally specific meanings in South Asia and around the world, ranging from the exploration of anything strange to the carrying out of a guru’s instructions, and, yes, the word also applies to sexual practices. </p><p>One overarching meaning that encompasses all is this: <em>Tantra, an applied method of acquiring freedom from external interference and of obtaining self-sovereignty (Sanskrit: </em>svādhikāra<em>) along this very path to transformation. </em></p><p>Join Tantric scholar-practitioners Sravana Borkataky-Varma and Keith Cantú for this fascinating signature series to explore the foundations of Tantric theory and practice. Together, we will immerse ourselves in the latest findings from academic research and ethnographic “participant observation” that challenge and reframe our conventional understandings of what Tantra was, is, and can be. Staying true to the roots of Esalen, we will intertwine the research and discussion with authentic Indian folk music performances and guided meditations to bring these new understandings creatively to life in your mind, body, and heart. Our collective practice of these new understandings will illuminate Tantra’s connections to a wide variety of vibrant artistic and meditative practices in an eye-opening and unforgettable way.</p><p>In this workshop, you’ll be invited to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Develop an embodied understanding of Tantra.</li><li>Learn to communicate your personal practice to friends and family using your new academic, researched-based understanding.</li><li>Creatively explore your divine potential.</li><li>Enjoy the benefit of overcoming negative projections and self-generated illusions.</li><li>Learn practical modes of meditation, including internal visualization and externalization through mandalas.</li><li>Understand the connections of Tantra to art and music, and see a broader continuum of its relevance in life.</li></ul><p>We invite you to join us for this series of workshops that will blend meditation, art, and music with a holistic inquiry into Tantra’s power and therapeutic potential. Bring an open mind as we explore deep questions about our bodies and minds in a safe space and nurturing environment.</p><p>Recommended reading: Chapter One of <em>The Hindu Tantric World</em> by André Padoux</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/freedom-and-self-sovereignty-tantra-the-body-and-the-release-an-esalen-signature-series-21723" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Tantra: The Body and The Release, an Esalen Signature Series | Freedom and Self-Sovereignty" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635437d47ef32d2ddc6a5684_Sravana-Borkataky-Varma-Keith-Edward-Cantu-circle-1022.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635437d47ef32d2ddc6a5684_Sravana-Borkataky-Varma-Keith-Edward-Cantu-circle-1022-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635437d47ef32d2ddc6a5684_Sravana-Borkataky-Varma-Keith-Edward-Cantu-circle-1022.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Tantra: The Body and The Release, an Esalen Signature Series | Freedom and Self-Sovereignty" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Sravana Borkataky-Varma and Keith Edward Cantú</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Tantra: The Body and The Release, an Esalen Signature Series | Freedom and Self-Sovereignty</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">February 17–20, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">February 17–20, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">February 17, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">February 17–20, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Have you noticed the painful effects of &nbsp;self-judgment?

By applying them to everyday life, we’ll begin to experience the simple yet profound potential for showing up more fully and authentically for the daily presentations of living an awake life.</p><p>Gestalt Practice cultivates curiosity, equanimity, and acceptance with greater choice for creative possibilities. Rather than focusing on fixing or achievement, this approach offers methods to encourage you to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Cultivate awareness and embodied presence.</li><li>Grow responsiveness, resilience, and choice.</li><li>Trust in your organism’s inherent capacity for self-regulation and co-regulation.</li></ul><p>Together, we’ll explore the elements of this approach, primarily through experiential personal practices, interactive exercises, and Gestalt Awareness Movement. Practices and exercises will be done solo, in pairs, triads, and groups, allowing participants to grow their awareness and learn how we can deepen our relationships — to self and others.</p><p>There will be time for some participants to experience classic one-to-one Open Seat practice sessions with Steven in the roles of Initiator and Reflector while in the context of the group. To enrich our understanding, we’ll touch upon the rich history, theory, and neuroscience that supports this approach.</p><p>Through Gestalt Practice, we bear witness to ineffable mysteries that can bring us to living life more fully. Participants are invited to show up: &nbsp;choosing to be present, paying attention to what has heart and meaning, and open to what life presents — letting life live through us.</p><p><em>The workshop is appropriate for all levels of experience with the understanding that participants are exploring a model of an awareness gym or lab — not a therapy. A welcome letter will be sent upon registration along with additional information about our time together.</em></p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/gestalt-practice-and-principles-cultivating-embodied-wholeness-in-daily-life-22623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Gestalt Practice and Principles: Cultivating Embodied Wholeness in Daily Life" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6307111921039823ace6c02f_Steven-Harper-circle-grey.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Gestalt Practice and Principles: Cultivating Embodied Wholeness in Daily Life" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8cbd9d4abb0744ec9acb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_17-Stephanie-Lewis-echinacea-bee.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Steven Harper</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Gestalt Practice and Principles: Cultivating Embodied Wholeness in Daily Life</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">February 26 – March 3, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">February 26 – March 3, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">February 26, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">February 26 – March 3, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>We are all participants in the ancient and the modern, the ego and the unconscious, the personal and the transcendent — though we all seem to forget these dual allegiances. When we go into nature, when we listen to music, when we encounter the numinous in whatever form it may manifest, we are reminded of our own truest nature, and we long for the reunion. Despite this, our egos inevitably feel threatened by the mysteries of these dualities; therefore, we all need ways of “re-membering” ourselves. </p><p>Throughout human history, shamans, mystics, and healers have found portals and pathways that challenge the ego’s primacy in order to encounter the Other within and emerge from the depths transformed. Carl Jung took a pathway he called Active Imagination, plunging himself into a dialogue with his soul that produced The Red Book. In this workshop, we will use Jung’s journey as a template to discover the creative potential accessible to us all. </p><p>As a unique mediator of opposites, music unfolds out of the interdependent relationship of consonance and dissonance. This workshop will explore music from neurobiological, spiritual, and experiential perspectives. </p><p>Through music’s ecstatic nature — live improvisations inspired by ancient healing techniques and &nbsp;performances of original music as well as the works of J.S. Bach, Robert Schumann, Philip Glass, and Arvo Pärt — you will be guided into yourself and reminded of yourself. Listen and allow the music to be the mediator of the dialogue. &nbsp;</p><p>To explore and deepen your relationship with the unconscious, we will work with practices such as:</p><ul role="list"><li>Deep listening experiences through music to generate alternate states of consciousness </li><li>Guided self-analysis</li><li>Journaling</li><li>Group discussion</li><li>Active imagination exploration</li><li>Lecture and study</li><li>Film </li></ul><p>Throughout the week, we will focus on practices for deep listening and the week will culminate in a concert inspired by Jung’s Red Book. Bringing decades of experience as Jungians, psychotherapists, and professional musicians, John and Rodney will set the stage for an exploration of those portals and pathways within.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/portals-and-pathways-ecstatic-experience-music-and-the-red-book-022723" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Portals and Pathways: Ecstatic Experience, Music, and The Red Book" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635445dcf8f7591f907ac7af_John-Price-Rodney-Waters-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635445dcf8f7591f907ac7af_John-Price-Rodney-Waters-circle-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635445dcf8f7591f907ac7af_John-Price-Rodney-Waters-circle.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Portals and Pathways: Ecstatic Experience, Music, and The Red Book" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">John W.

Like breathing, we do not choose to feel our emotions – we automatically emote in response to the challenges and opportunities of life. While <em>emotions</em> are vital to our human existence, emotional <em>reactions</em> can become the source of interpersonal challenges in our lives. Often, these strong emotional reactions are triggered from far below the surface of conscious thought.</p><p>Automatic reaction is not our only option, however. We can learn to bring conscious awareness to our emotions, and train our minds to respond to difficult emotions in constructive ways. Even our pleasant emotions can be enhanced by conscious awareness. We can savor the good and feel appreciation, rather than grasp for joy.</p><p>In developing emotional awareness, we can increase our ability to hold the full range of our human experience with compassion and curiosity. &nbsp; </p><p>Throughout this experiential workshop, we will offer the foundational science and practice of emotional awareness, woven together with an experience of heart-opening and interactive contemplative art. We will draw from the evidence-based <em>Cultivating Emotional Balance</em> training, which integrates the wisdom traditions of modern psychology, emotion research, and ancient contemplative practices as a path for transformation. </p><p>Each session will balance learning, being, and connecting. Within our sweet container, we will explore: </p><ul role="list"><li>Teachings on the scientific and contemplative foundations of emotional awareness.</li><li>Being with guided meditations and reflective practices to develop mindful awareness and compassion for our patterns and habits, while connecting to inner sources of joy and appreciation. </li><li>Connective practices, including discussion and small group work, to investigate the roots of our emotions through the mapping of our emotional episodes.</li></ul><p>As we map our emotions, we may uncover the stories underlying our triggers, perceptions, and responses. These stories are often humblingly familiar. In their sharing, it is possible to understand and feel the interconnection of emotions, interconnection with each other, and forge new narratives to make meaning with our emotional lives.</p><p>Join us for this weekend of transformative exploration and practice.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/cultivating-emotional-awareness-and-balance-030623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Cultivating Emotional Awareness and Balance" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635eb49ad32884526a6e83f5_eve-ekman-teague-omalley-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635eb49ad32884526a6e83f5_eve-ekman-teague-omalley-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635eb49ad32884526a6e83f5_eve-ekman-teague-omalley-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Cultivating Emotional Awareness and Balance" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Eve Ekman and Teague O'Malley</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Cultivating Emotional Awareness and Balance</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">March 3–6, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">March 3–6, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">March 3, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">March 3–6, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>In Visceral Manipulation 1 (VM1), you will study the models and theories of functional biomechanics as viewed from Barral's innovative approach.</p><p>Workshop highlights include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Learning manual skills to locate, evaluate and normalize primary areas of dysfunction within the abdominal cavity</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Exploring the dynamics of motion and suspension in relation to organs, membranes and ligaments</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Examining the relationship of organs and structural or neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction</li></ul><ul role="list"><li>Assessing the quality of functional activity and somatic structures as they relate to an overall pattern</li></ul><p><em>Prerequisite: This course is intended for licensed or certified healthcare professionals, or for students nearing completion in their studies to become a healthcare professional, with palpation skills and experience as well as anatomical knowledge.

The answers to these questions will help you navigate life’s journey with direction, motivation, and inspiration. </p><p>Perhaps the greatest regret of the dying is that they lacked the courage to live a life true to themselves. In this workshop, you will reconnect with your authentic self through a series of exercises, such as guided meditation, self-inquiry, journaling, Emotional Freedom Technique (also known as Tapping), and one-on-one and group sharing and embodiment practices. This curated process is designed to allow you space to get clear about:</p><ul role="list"><li>Your purpose</li><li>Your core values</li><li>Your message</li><li>Your big vision</li></ul><p>With that clarity, you can create your manifesto, a written statement declaring who you truly are.

You will also have the opportunity to apply these insights to cultivate authentic interactions with others. As you deepen the embodiment of your native self, you’ll experience the great freedom of simply being you. This is one of the greatest victories you can possibly achieve: living a courageous life true to yourself — with no regrets.</p><p>Please bring a journal and pen to every session.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/authentic-alignment-031023" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Authentic Alignment" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635eb7ed7a08e2d6458fcb93_anne-van-de-water-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Authentic Alignment" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Anne Van de Water</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Authentic Alignment</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">March 10–12, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">March 10–12, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">March 10, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">March 10–12, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>True happiness is not about acquiring anything; instead, it comes from opening to the natural joy and aliveness inside you.

It is a tender reality which has perhaps always existed in the background of your awareness, where its presence may arise more explicitly in life’s transitions and transformations. But what exactly <em>IS </em>grace? And – importantly – &nbsp;how do we gain access to it? </p><p>Grace can be defined as the direct experience of Divine Presence coming alive from within you. Experiencing grace can reconnect you to the source of love, clarity, peace, strength, and joy. Grace is more available than you might think to help you live with spiritual depth. It can support you while you learn to embody and integrate your noble qualities deeper into daily life and begin to radiate the benefits to your loved ones and community. &nbsp; </p><p>In this retreat, Miranda will share rich teachings and practices to help you relax out of ego fear and control, and take you on a journey into the four dimensions of grace:</p><ul role="list"><li>Grounding in Grace</li><li>Receiving the Blessings of grace</li><li>The Transforming Power of Grace</li><li>Embodying Grace more deeply into your life</li></ul><p>Within a palpable atmosphere of unconditional love, we will explore the most important themes of your life and these times. Through powerful inquiry exercises, meditation practices, beautiful music, and group reflection, we will illuminate your obstacles and let your consciousness refine so that you can relax more substantially to the luminous presence at your core.</p><p>Miranda has been guiding others into direct experience of the sacred for over thirty years internationally.

Answer the call of 55000 Highway 1’s healing waters and join Douglas and Little Bear on a hero’s journey. Together, we will explore &nbsp;what it means to embody the sacred masculine in this modern world. With courage, integrity, and receptivity, as a group we will create renewed understandings of masculinity and how we as men ‘walk our talk.’</p><p>Healthy and uplifting rites of passage are an important aspect of humanity, and yet, largely missing from modern society. People of all walks of life and religions went through different experiences in order to prove that they were ready to move into their next stage of life. Men were traditionally taught by their fathers, grandfathers, and uncles, but this traditional upbringing is frequently &nbsp;missing for many. In order to overcome the accepted norms of masculinity, it is important for men to be able to find solace with one another, to relate at the heart level, and to learn from each other.</p><p>In this weeklong workshop we will have the opportunity to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Learn about the practice of acknowledging the land</li><li>Use dance, voice, and 5Rhythms® movement to feel into our bodies</li><li>Participate in the reconstruction of traditional rites of passage</li><li>Seek deeper connection with Mother Earth</li></ul><p>The intention for our week together are to create a sacred space for men to come together and reignite our sacred fire, as well as to build a new bridge to manhood, to gentle warriorhood. </p><p>Guest musicians Sanga of the Valley and Nick Ayers will accompany this workshop. </p><p>Sanga of the Valley has played African drums from an early age. Sanga moved to New York City in 1970 from Trinidad, where he met Babatunde Olatunji and became one of Olatunji’s students. Sanga went on to be one of Olatunji’s lead djembe players and spent 25 years as a member of Olatunji’s Drums of Passion. Sanga of the Valley has worked with artists such as Carlos Santana, Nina Simone, The Grateful Dead, the Neville Brothers, and Stanley Jordan.</p><p>Nick Ayers has been a professional musician and dancer for over 25 years. Nick knows the sensitivities of deep listening. He is a massage practitioner at the Esalen Institute and the creator of the Wavetable, a vibro-acoustic sound table that massages the body through his original musical compositions.</p><p>If you would like to begin your own journey to understand the past and present of the Esselen Tribe of Monterey Country or to support the tribe in the progress of its work, please visit <a href="http://www.esselentribe.org/" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">www.esselentribe.org</a>.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/healing-waters-rites-of-passage-the-embodied-masculine-31323" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Healing Waters: Rites of Passage &amp; The Embodied Masculine" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635ec2581b24c5ea0533546d_tom-little-bear-nason-douglas-drummond-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635ec2581b24c5ea0533546d_tom-little-bear-nason-douglas-drummond-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635ec2581b24c5ea0533546d_tom-little-bear-nason-douglas-drummond-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Healing Waters: Rites of Passage &amp; The Embodied Masculine" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Tom Little Bear Nason and Douglas Drummond</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Healing Waters: Rites of Passage &amp; The Embodied Masculine</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">March 13–17, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">March 13–17, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">March 13, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">March 13–17, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><em>“We will become our opposite if we do not learn to accommodate the opposite within us.” &nbsp;– Carl Jung</em></p><p>At the heart of contemplative life is the archetypal journey – returning home to the ground of our essential being, our true nature, which is love. Buddhism teaches that when we split from the &nbsp;“ground of being,” we can either take the path of remembrance or forgetting.</p><p>The path of remembrance teaches that when we remember who we truly are, we know that we are the ground, and we feel whole and can experience the liberation and freedom of nirvana. On the other hand, if we take the path of forgetting (which is what most of us have taken), we forget that we are the ground, which leads us to <em>samsara,</em> to feeling lost, empty, anxious, alone, and disconnected from love. </p><p>Whether we experience nirvana or samsara depends on our own minds, the crux is that they are not two different places – <em>they are states of mind</em>. </p><p>Meditation is one of the most impactful tools we have for cultivating positive mental states, states of being that enable us to experience the ground as it truly is, and gain confidence and maturity. This is the teaching on “one ground, two paths, two results” that we will explore together.</p><p><em>“Our fears are like dragons guarding our deepest treasures.” – Rainer Maria Rilke</em></p><p>In this retreat, we will complement our meditation practice with shadow work called Feeding Your Demons® (FYD), an exquisite five-step process whereby we offer attention and compassion to our inner obstacles, our “demons.” In this context, demons are those thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that block our experience of freedom. This process is greatly beneficial when working with various personal demons and other dilemmas of modern life. A 2018 FYD pilot study found that working through this process was associated with increased self-compassion, emotional awareness, and self-regulation, satisfaction with life, and decreased stress, craving, depression, and intolerance for uncertainty. FYD transcends spiritual constructs, serving as a meaningful tool for anybody, regardless of religious affiliation or personal philosophy. </p><p>In this retreat, you will experience:</p><ul role="list"><li>Meditation practices indoors and out in nature, gazing over the Pacific Ocean, weather permitting.</li><li>Teachings and discussions on the seminal Buddhist teaching of “one ground, two paths, two results.”</li><li>Five step Feeding Your Demons® personal process. &nbsp; </li><li>Gentle and accessible therapeutic yoga to bring more comfort and ease to your meditation and your life.</li></ul><p>Please bring loose, comfortable clothing, a journal, writing implements, and if you have art supplies, such as colored pencils, pens, pastels, and/or watercolor, feel free to bring them.

She will facilitate the 5Rhythms movement practice as a way of experientially accessing and transforming the emotional states that come with grief. </li><li>Peter is a physician with more than thirty years of experience in HIV/AIDS, palliative care, and grief work for caregivers, working in a community now heavily affected by Covid-19, and will facilitate an exploration of stages of grief, using story-sharing as part of releasing and working through losses. </li></ul><p>The weekend also includes didactic and experiential sessions focused on natural and distorted emotional responses to grief, caregiving vs. caretaking, and more. </p><p>Please bring photos or other mementos of anyone whose memory you would like to bring into the workshop.</p><p><a href="https://esalen.secure.retreat.guru/wp-content/uploads/sites/305/2019/08/2020.04.17_Horan-and-Selwyn_5Rhythms-Grief-Loss-Motion_Syllabus-Web.pdf" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">View the continuing education syllabus.</a></p><p>10 hours of CE credit for: </p><ul role="list"><li>Massage Therapists </li><li>MFTs, LCSWs, LEPs, LPCCs </li><li>Nurses</li></ul></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/grief-dancer-031723" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="5Rhythms®: Grief, Loss, and the Body in Motion" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635ec5576bdad049e26135bb_lucia-horan-peter-selwyn-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635ec5576bdad049e26135bb_lucia-horan-peter-selwyn-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/635ec5576bdad049e26135bb_lucia-horan-peter-selwyn-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="5Rhythms®: Grief, Loss, and the Body in Motion" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8c18b9a23c4066b2f524_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_9-Ali-Kaukas-white-flower.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Lucia Horan and Peter Selwyn</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">5Rhythms®: Grief, Loss, and the Body in Motion</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">March 17–20, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">March 17–20, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">March 17, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">March 17–20, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>When the world around us is polarized and the future is uncertain, gathering in community, living in our bodies, and expressing the truth is more important than ever.</p><p>In this transformative five-day writing workshop, we’ll use ritual and deep writing to connect with our inner voice, discover the healing power of language, and birth powerful true stories onto the page. Evocative prompts, movement, and guided meditation will lead you deeply into the world of language and story.

Repeated application of these mystic practices will help you to deliver valuable readings without being energetically drained and build your confidence and skill as a tarot reader.</p><p>To provide you with continued support when you return home and begin offering readings for your family and friends, this workshop tuition also includes Brenda’s original deck, <em>The Beauty of Tarot, </em>and a workbook chronicling each card. &nbsp;</p><p>This immersion welcomes all levels of experience, from “I’ve always been curious” to “I’ve had a deck for years” to “I’ve been doing readings but want to deepen my understanding of the cards” and more. &nbsp;As a result, every student will have the opportunity to gain immense insight from this tarot class and Esalen community.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/learning-tarot-awakening-the-magic-of-your-own-inner-guidance-032023" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Learning Tarot: Awakening The Magic of Your Own Inner Guidance" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/635ec755ddd313bd72afe9d3_brenda-rose-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Learning Tarot: Awakening The Magic of Your Own Inner Guidance" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Brenda Rose</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Learning Tarot: Awakening The Magic of Your Own Inner Guidance</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">March 20–24, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">March 20–24, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">March 20, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">March 20–24, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><em>And there came a time when the risk of remaining closed tight in a bud far outweighed the risk it took to bloom.” – Anaïs Nin </em></p><p>Spring is the season of new beginnings; it brings major shifts and changes.

This experiential workshop blends slow, developmental movement explorations with individual and group Gestalt work to address how habitual, unconscious beliefs and behaviors formed early in life lead to habitual ways of responding that limit life experience.</p><p>Through mindfulness, explorations of forgotten movement patterns, and Relational Gestalt &nbsp;Practice, we contact the here-and-now, where change and growth are possible. As we become more present in our bodies, we may discover an inability to identify what we are feeling, or that — because of painful memories, and difficulty experiencing feelings directly — we have been avoiding them.</p><p>This is a relational process. Working in an empathic, supportive group setting creates a container in which new ways of moving and being can be expressed and explored. This workshop provides the experience of making contact with people who are present and accepting, making it possible to develop a greater capacity for feelings. We can then learn to use our feelings as guides that help us live more authentically, moving beyond habits of being and relating that no longer serve us.

Every organ, bone, body part, and movement holds an energy, a feeling, a memory that calls our attention and seeks expression. With curiosity and care to the stories our bodies hold, we become embodied artists, choreographers of our life experience. </p><p>This workshop will be a creative exploration and discovery of what truly matters in your life through movement and art making, listening to the body, and listening to the heart. When we don’t take time or know how to be creative listeners, the body will tell its stories in disabling ways. Encountering our bodies creatively, we discover artful ways to re-story ourselves, bringing new vision to the life themes that matter to us.</p><p>A process called Body Mapping will lead participants through an art based journey with each body part. Challenges and resources will be identified and explored as rich material for movement, art making, group collaboration and ritual. Participants will explore personal and group creativity, body – mind connections, and engage with psychological themes relevant to our historical and everyday lives. </p><p>Morning sessions will focus on somatic awareness – individual and group movement exploration to tune the physical body to sensation and feeling. Afternoon sessions will facilitate creative encounters with the art mediums of dance, drawing, and spoken and written narrative. Evening sessions will be devoted to presentations of the work created, reflection and questions generated by the day’s work, releasing activities and meditative art practices. </p><p>Participants will explore:</p><ul role="list"><li>Expanding body awareness through somatic movement experiences.</li><li>Utilizing the creative arts to explore life narratives.

Happy as in deep contentment. We all long to feel at ease, to be at peace, to know that we’re okay and that life is okay. Most of us are deeply habituated to looking for this happiness outside ourselves, to grasp and scramble for an experience that, at best, ends up being fleeting, and then something we long for again. We forget that this feeling we desire is already seated in the heart of who we are — and that it’s always available if only we look within. When we do, we can transform far more than just our own lives.</p><p>Ask yourself these questions:</p><ul role="list"><li>Have you ever touched this peace, this contentment, this deep knowing of who you truly are?</li><li>Have you ever struggled because you recognized the world around you did not reflect this experience of humanity’s true nature?</li><li>When faced with the enormity of the collective problems before us, how can one individual’s spiritual practice make a tangible difference in our world?</li></ul><p>These questions will guide our time together on retreat as we explore how meditation, mindfulness, and contemplative technologies designed for the realization of personal freedom can — and must — be applied collectively. Our daily meditation practice will serve as a framework onto which we will begin to weave teachings with personal reflections. You will have the opportunity to connect to yourself and others and the world beyond in solo and group exercises, and discussion that inspire us to put our values into action.</p><p>We hope you will join us in remembering the deepest truth of who we are, with the intention of using this understanding to transform our own lives <em>and</em> the world we share.</p><p>Opportunities for <strong>scholarships</strong>/<strong>BIPOC scholarships</strong> are available by application for this retreat. </p><p>https://www.caverlymorgan.org/theheartofwhoweare</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/the-heart-of-who-we-are-personal-freedom-and-collective-change-40323" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Heart of Who We Are: Personal Freedom and Collective Change" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/636fdbbaad2b306b596d442b_caverly-morgan-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Heart of Who We Are: Personal Freedom and Collective Change" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Caverly Morgan</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">The Heart of Who We Are: Personal Freedom and Collective Change</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 3–7, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 3–7, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 3, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 3–7, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Our bodies reflect the natural world.

After absorbing the essentials of balanced posture, alignment, and breathing, you’ll enjoy step-by-step instruction in all 12 movements of Hunyuan (Primordial) Qigong. This comprehensive system of meditative energy exercises purges the body of toxic or stagnant <em>qi</em> (circulating life force), clears the major acupuncture meridians, and teaches you how to gather and absorb <em>qi</em> from nature.</p><p>Primordial Qigong is meditation in motion and includes the two most famous forms of Taoist Meditation: the Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Energy Circulation, in which the solar (<em>yang</em>) and lunar (<em>yin</em>) energies flow in harmony, an essential key to vitality and longevity. You will also learn how to recharge the three <em>dan tians</em>, the body’s primary energy “batteries,” to increase your storehouse of resilient <em>qi</em> (life force) as a buffer against stress and other challenges to well-being. During discussion time, we’ll discover how science explains the benefits of qigong and how the practice is redefining our understanding of health. Primordial Qigong is the legacy of Ken’s teacher Madame Gao Fu, in direct lineage from the founder of the “medical qigong” movement in modern China. The course is perfect for beginners and all levels.</p><p>In this weeklong workshop, you’ll have the opportunity to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Learn all 12 movements of Hunyuan (Primordial) Qigong for strong, resilient energy.</li><li>Practice the two most famous forms of Taoist Meditation: the Microcosmic and Macrocosmic Orbits (or Energy Circulation techniques) to awaken and harmonize the primary acupuncture meridians.</li><li>Recharge the internal “batteries,” the <em>dan tians,</em> and learn about their connection with slow, deep breathing.</li><li>Improve posture, alignment, movement efficiency, and breathing.</li><li>Discover how science measures the healing benefits of qigong and how the practice is redefining human health and human potential.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Recommended reading: <em>The Way of Qigong: The Art and Science of Chinese Energy Healing, </em>by Kenneth Cohen</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/primordial-qigong-vibrant-health-harmony-with-the-tao-40923" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Primordial Qigong: Vibrant Health, Harmony with the Tao" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/636fe27b95aca8f25dd70172_kenneth-cohen-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Primordial Qigong: Vibrant Health, Harmony with the Tao" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Kenneth Cohen</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Primordial Qigong: Vibrant Health, Harmony with the Tao</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 9–14, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 9–14, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 9, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 9–14, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>There is an inner community inside of us, a community of selves. Some have a voice, and some are quiet. Some are known through sensation, emotion, and thought. Other selves have agendas, advice, and accusations.</p><p>Each of these selves has a history, an emotional state, and a felt sense in the body. Each represents a particular aspect or part of our (mostly) Unified Self. In mindful movement, we can substantiate selves that have been hiding or cast out. We can learn to calm the selves that work overtime, find unknown selves, and embody a self we have been waiting to become.</p><p>Andrea facilitates a dynamic, non-judgmental, well-informed dance playground to embody these inner conversations. This practice is not only fun and awakening, but an exploration of any distinct part of our personalities can help illuminate what is held within and what its cost is. Additionally, the creativity of dance illuminates new possibilities and choices. </p><p>Come join us for this essential and transformative work, where we will explore:</p><ul role="list"><li>Movement dance</li><li>Inquiry/self-reflection</li><li>Sharing</li><li>Individual process</li><li>Group process</li></ul><p>When we allow it, the embodiment of our different selves supports integration, shared knowledge, and congruence within whom we call “me, myself, or I.” Learning the practice of learning the ten Core Movement Resources anchors us in the felt sense of <em>that which</em> <em>moves from one self to another</em>. It’s often hard to taste this in our day-to-day life, but put those selves, intentionally, into movement on the Open Floor, and who we are beyond a self is often surprisingly available to us.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/open-floor-movement-community-of-selves-41023" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Open Floor Movement: Community of Selves" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/636fe448e90ebedcabc57a0f_andrea-juhan-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Open Floor Movement: Community of Selves" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9239346ec73db471afa2_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_8-Ami-Sioux-Leonard-Pavilion.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Andrea Juhan</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Open Floor Movement: Community of Selves</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 10–14, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 10–14, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 10, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 10–14, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>In this basic skills workshop, couples, partners, and friends will refine their relationship with touch, our forgotten language.

The edgy wildness of Esalen’s grounds, canyons, hot springs, and mountain backdrop invite this deeper connection<strong>.</strong></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbzYQ2d-X-GoKFYIyFCo3RrEkiKi7wVC/view?usp=sharing" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">View the continuing education syllabus.</a></p><p>10 hours of CE credit for Massage Therapists.</p><p>Recommended reading: <em>Connecting Through Touch</em> by Peggy Horan</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/esalen-r-massage-for-couples-and-friends-41423" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Esalen® Massage for Couples, Friends, or Family Members" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/636fe54dd991c3834cc06b5e_dean-marson-robin-fann-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/636fe54dd991c3834cc06b5e_dean-marson-robin-fann-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/636fe54dd991c3834cc06b5e_dean-marson-robin-fann-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Esalen® Massage for Couples, Friends, or Family Members" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8b7e44a03f2a948f9218_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_3-Kodiak-Greenwood-massage.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Dean Marson and Robin Fann-Costanzo</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Esalen® Massage for Couples, Friends, or Family Members</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 14–16, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 14–16, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 14, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 14–16, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Since falling in love is biologically natural, but sustaining love is biologically unnatural, <em>Soul Mate</em> focuses on the art and discipline of sustaining love. You begin with learning how to appreciate your partner so specifically and frequently that your partner feels fully seen and loved. </p><p>You then practice both the art and discipline of hearing your partner’s criticisms without becoming defensive. For example, so you don’t have to fear “walking on eggshells” before sharing a concern, your partner first learns how to prepare her or himself to emotionally associate your criticism with an opportunity to be more deeply loved. </p><p><em>Soul Mate</em> is designed as the next evolutionary shift beyond active listening. Active listening allowed the criticizer to feel heard, but failed to teach the person hearing the criticism how to emotionally associate the criticism with an opportunity to be more deeply loved. The problem? Unless the receiver of criticism feels safe the person sharing their concern cannot feel safe.</p><p>You will learn a series of practices you may integrate into your everyday life:</p><ul role="list"><li>Six methods of sustaining a “conflict free zone” for 166 hours of your 168-hour week. </li><li>A “Caring and Sharing Time” the remaining two hours by practicing six mindsets that allow you to not feel defensive when criticized. </li><li>“Eight Wisdoms” as a foundation for deepening your love</li><li>The four “depleters of love,” aka the “Four C’s” (Criticisms, Complaints, Controlling, and Complacency)</li><li>How to use your new skills with your children, parents and colleagues at work.</li><li>How to use music and dancing to revitalize your love (to be practiced by dancing before each session)</li></ul><p>To sustain your practice after the workshop, I invite you to multiple free, ongoing, group follow-up calls to resolve stumbling blocks. If you wish to review the insights and exercises at any time, you will also have the option of purchasing a Zoom version of the course. </p><p>This workshop is for couples of all genders and sexual orientations. A couple may be any two people with a history who desire a better future e.g., parents or partners, married or divorced; newlyweds; parent-child; siblings; etc.). Developed over the past 30 years, the workshop is also used by many health professionals in their work with clients and patients.</p><p>Recommended resources: <em>Women Can’t Hear What Men Don’t Say</em>, pp. 1-87, by Dr. Warren Farrell; additional video content on <a href="https://warrenfarrell.com/couples-communication/" target="_blank" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">warrenfarrell.com.</a></p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/role-mate-to-soul-mate-the-art-and-discipline-of-love-41423" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Role Mate to Soul Mate: The Art and Discipline of Love" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63700016e17c4e70f489aec9_warren-farrell-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Role Mate to Soul Mate: The Art and Discipline of Love" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a9059c4293429587309e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_4-Ali-Kaukas-red-flower.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Warren Farrell</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Role Mate to Soul Mate: The Art and Discipline of Love</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 14–17, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 14–17, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 14, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 14–17, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Experience “process painting” with Stewart Cubley and staff.</p><p>In this expressive painting workshop, participants will enjoy artistic freedom — creating without the pressure to perform, produce, or succeed. Everyone will be a beginner. Whether you are a veteran painter or picking up a paintbrush for the first time, this experience will be about the creative process rather than technique, training, or expertise.</p><p>In the respectful and nurturing studio environment, you’ll receive individual attention and gentle guidance to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Discover a creative voice that’s entirely your own.</li><li>Trust your intuitive perception, not the mind’s critical chatter.</li><li>Follow your own authentic energy rather than painting for others.</li><li>Experience your imagination as a doorway to deeper knowing.</li><li>Reveal the hidden invitations in so-called “creative blocks.”</li><li>Explore process painting as a genuine path to spiritual awakening.</li></ul><p>One of the myths of art is that you have to feel inspired and confident in order to create. On the contrary, not-knowing allows innocence, accepting imperfection yields compassion, and risking vulnerability opens the door to breakthrough and awe. In that spirit, there will be no critiques, analyses, or judgments of the work. This workshop may interest people from a wide variety of disciplines, including art, education, counseling, social change, and meditative practices.</p><p>All materials are supplied, including high-quality, non-toxic liquid tempera on paper and high-quality brushes.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/awakening-the-creative-the-painting-experience-41623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Awakening the Creative: The Painting Experience" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/636ff2f5e72379a8186bcfb1_stewart-cubley-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Awakening the Creative: The Painting Experience" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92cc4e9802329b1808ad_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_18-Stephanie-Lewis-Art-Barn.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Stewart Cubley</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Awakening the Creative: The Painting Experience</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 16–21, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 16–21, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 16, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 16–21, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Have you created the impact you want? Are you showing up the way you want to? Are you going in the right direction? You have never been where you are today. You have never been the age you are today, or had the experience you have today. This is your time to pause and reflect. Rarely do we allow ourselves the time to stop and look at what is changing and what we need to feel fulfilled. </p><p>This is a very interactive workshop with lots of experiential exercises. The content includes important theory and plenty of reflection time, but this workshop will not be a series of talks/lectures. There will be movement, coaching, a little dance, and lots of activity in the whole group. All participation is voluntary at all times. </p><p>Through this experiential week, we will create a courageous community to both challenge and nurture ourselves. Our goal is to step back from our lives and renew ourselves. Participants will have the opportunity to learn what brings them joy and purpose, and cultivate a vision to serve as a foundation for both the next year and next phase of life. </p><p>We will engage in a progression of individual and group exercises focused on reflection, movement, and listening to our inner wisdom. In the process, we will discover how to navigate the stages of major life transitions, practice the skills to access our intuition, and reveal which of our behaviors either support or unconsciously undermine our overall success. The experience will be especially valuable for those who are passionate about having a more powerful and authentic impact on the world around them.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/designing-the-life-we-want-self-renewal-in-the-spring-041723" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal in the Spring" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/639e13c0bd9fea2661f8db03_mark-nicolson-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal in the Spring" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8e0757859fc6eabe2ca3_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_2-Ali-Kaukas-purple-flowers.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Mark Nicolson</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal in the Spring</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 17–21, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 17–21, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 17, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 17–21, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>What is the relationship between our physical substance and subtle bodies? In this workshop, we aim to individually and collectively understand physical and subtle bodies and their importance and relationship in Tantric traditions. Together, we’ll trace the historical development of the Tantric body with its physiology of wheels and channels. We will also review the desire of the Theosophists and later New Age authors to map the so-called “astral body” and earlier cosmic bodies onto the Tantric body. </p><p>Join Tantric scholar-practitioners Sravana Borkataky-Varma and Keith Cantú as we explore the foundations of Tantric theory and practice. Together, we will immerse ourselves in the latest findings from academic research and ethnographic “participant observation” that challenge and reframe our conventional understandings of what Tantra was, is, and can be. Staying true to the roots of Esalen, we will intertwine research and discussion with authentic Indian folk music performances and guided meditations for a creative, visceral experience for the mind, body, and heart. Our collective practice of these new understandings will illuminate Tantra’s connections to a wide variety of vibrant artistic and meditative practices in an eye-opening and unforgettable way.</p><p>We invite you to join us in this workshop that blends meditation, art, and music with a holistic inquiry into Tantra’s power and therapeutic potential.

It is said that Big Sur is not just a place but a state of mind. This wilderness experience seeks to merge mind and place, then to embody what is learned.</p><p>Participants in this weeklong workshop will venture out into the emerging springtime magnificence of Big Sur on day-hikes between four to eight miles. Steven and Gary will draw from a wide range of contemporary and age-old wisdom traditions, borrowing from psychology, meditation, aikido, and the natural sciences to weave together a holistic experience of self and the natural world. </p><p>Each hike will begin right after breakfast and conclude in time to enjoy the hot springs and dinner at the Lodge. Evening sessions will include informal sharing and basic awareness practices with attention to incorporating what we’ve learned into our daily lives. </p><p>All levels of experience are welcome. Be prepared for the invigorating challenge of physical activity and the opportunity to simply sit still in quiet reflection. More information and a waiver will be sent upon registration.

This workshop offers a wide array of resources and teachings to help participants address that final unfinished business and make the most out of every moment that comes before it.</p><p>All of life is held within the context of its inevitable extinction. By acknowledging and preparing for death now, we will find ourselves living more fully and fearlessly. Join us as we celebrate the preciousness of life, and ready ourselves and others for this final journey. We will learn how to die a good death and help others pass, exploring meditations and contemplations that prepare us for letting go. As the Buddhist tradition proclaims, “If you die before you die, then when you die, you will not die.”</p><p>With preparation, we can transcend death, turning the greatest obstacle into a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and even attain enlightenment. The bardo teachings lead to the death of death. The journey through the bardos is a journey into our mind, so by exploring the bardos, we are exploring ourselves. The teachings apply to any moment that ends – which means they also relate to daily life and can help you live fully within the time you are given.</p><p>Together we’ll explore:</p><ul role="list"><li>Meditations that prepare you for the end of life</li><li>Teachings that support the meditations</li><li>Discussion groups to create a sense of community &nbsp;</li></ul><p>We hope you’ll join us for this exploration into the unknown, so that we may all return – fearless, and full of compassion for ourselves and those transitioning from this life.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/graceful-exit-preparing-for-a-good-death-42823" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Graceful Exit: Preparing for a Good Death" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/637016da03470cae8aa4076f_andrew-holecek-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Graceful Exit: Preparing for a Good Death" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Andrew Holecek</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Graceful Exit: Preparing for a Good Death</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">April 28 – May 1, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">April 28 – May 1, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">April 28, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">April 28 – May 1, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Our sense of self develops in connection with others and our experiences in early relationships.

In the practice of the 5Rhythms, we engage in mindfulness while in motion.</p><p>Together, these two polarities mirror the dance of life and open the door to peace, well-being, and balance. </p><p>Recommended reading: <em>Spiritual Fertility,</em> by Dr. Julie Von; <em>Dancing with the Dharma: Essays on Movement and Dance in Western Buddhism,</em> edited by Harrison Blum; <em>Sweat Your Prayers,</em> by Gabrielle Roth</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/moon-lodge-honoring-the-sacred-feminine-050123" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Moon Lodge: Honoring the Sacred Feminine" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6398c5531b4d8669bc876e9f_lucia-horan-julie-von-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6398c5531b4d8669bc876e9f_lucia-horan-julie-von-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6398c5531b4d8669bc876e9f_lucia-horan-julie-von-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Moon Lodge: Honoring the Sacred Feminine" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8f738563257faad75f82_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_27-Kodiak-Greenwood-tubs-sunset.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Lucia Horan and Dr. Julie Von</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Moon Lodge: Honoring the Sacred Feminine</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">May 1–5, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">May 1–5, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">May 1, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">May 1–5, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Everyone has a story. This workshop is about being in a safe place to finally get that story (which has been marinating in your pancreas, your liver, your heart) out onto the page. It’s about sounding like you. Using your own voice, your own language, your own rhythms, telling your own story, and taking the risk of saying, “This is who I am … This is what happened to me. And this is how I got from here to there.” </p><p>Writing a memoir is not about trying to impress anyone with how smart you are. With humor and compassion, Aronie draws you into building a safe and authentic group field, and it melts away the fear and the doubt, making your authenticity and your vulnerability the most important part of the work. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will finally get going on the book you’ve been waiting to write.</p><p>Aronie has one rule: When you finish reading, we tell you what we loved. The workshop is not about publishing. It’s about the <em>process</em>. You will be given prompts and time to write, and then the group will read their writings together, in the safe container built during the program. You will take away the confidence and the excitement to keep going when you get home.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/jumpstart-your-memoir-050523" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Jumpstart Your Memoir" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6398c86418e66f2d5f4e36e8_nancy-aronie-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Jumpstart Your Memoir" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a92759d4abb5defed0667_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_16-Emma-Barry-lawn-flowers-chair.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Nancy Slonim Aronie</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Jumpstart Your Memoir</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">May 5–7, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">May 5–7, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">May 5, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">May 5–7, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Learn to activate the right side of your brain to unlock the insights necessary to break through self-limiting patterns.

Be willing to try on all ranges of emotion as we wake up and turn on our ability to feel everything deeply. Be ready to listen sincerely and share with others, both one-on-one and in groups. Be open to powerful release experiences through psychodrama, breathwork, pranayama, meditation, and movement. </p><p>Devarshi has devoted his life to uncovering, studying, practicing, and teaching tools for transformation. He is respected for his gift of synthesizing traditional and modern wisdom to inspire, support, and awaken.

This practice was created as a powerful way to enter non-ordinary states of consciousness without psychedelic medicines. This workshop will include four Holotropic sessions during the week.</p><p>Our days will begin with an energizing and empowering <em>kata</em>, led by Mac Murphy, who trained in breathwork during a seven-month immersion at the Five Immortals Temple in Wudang, Hubei Province, China. Mac will guide us in early morning qigong practice and through his Tummo- and Wim Hof-inspired breathing practices. Those interested can also take a cold water plunge at Hot Springs Creek. There will be time afterward to share feedback.</p><p>Participants will explore breathing practices designed to calm the nervous system and elicit effects documented in <em>The Relaxation Response</em> and <em>The Relaxation Revolution</em> by Herbert Benson, MD, co-founder of the Harvard Mind-Body Clinic.</p><p>Our three-hour afternoon sessions will be entirely dedicated to the study of Holotropic Breathwork, which begins with both “sitter” and “breather” guided into full body relaxation. The sitter then assumes a comfortable position close to the breather’s upper body with access to the head and shoulders. Accelerated breathing is supported by evocative music specifically chosen to move upward through the chakra system. The last hour is for resolution, including possible bodywork and creative expressions of our experiences, such as drawing mandalas, writing poetry, and more.</p><p>To read more about Holotropic Breathwork, please read Stan Grof’s book <em>The Holotropic Mind</em>, or review these videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCzG9QsM-Pw&amp;t=91s" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><em>Stanislav Grof – Holotropic Breathing</em></a> (YouTube), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VcUJjRC-Hc" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><em>Stanislav Grof: Holotropic Bodywork Workshop [Part 1]</em></a> (YouTube), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US4kUV6MbCg" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><em>James Nestor Had a “Transformative” Experience in His Holotropic Breathing Class</em></a> (YouTube)</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/transpersonal-breathwork-practices-holotropic-breathwork-r-qigong-and-complementary-breathwork-katas-050723" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Transpersonal Breathwork Practices: Holotropic Breathwork®, Qigong, and Complementary Breathwork Katas" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6398c92ecc5cac96b1a57df9_ellen-watson-mac-murphy-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6398c92ecc5cac96b1a57df9_ellen-watson-mac-murphy-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6398c92ecc5cac96b1a57df9_ellen-watson-mac-murphy-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Transpersonal Breathwork Practices: Holotropic Breathwork®, Qigong, and Complementary Breathwork Katas" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Ellen Watson and Mac Murphy</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Transpersonal Breathwork Practices: Holotropic Breathwork®, Qigong, and Complementary Breathwork Katas</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">May 7–12, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">May 7–12, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">May 7, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">May 7–12, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><em>Special Note: This workshop will be held as a 2-night, 3-day, and also have the option to extend your time and workshop content into a third night and fourth day. &nbsp;To extend your time with Mark and Lori, select the “Additional Night” option when completing your reservation.</em></p><p>Are you longing to be in the beauty of the outdoors to relish in the wonder of nature?

It is used to treat a myriad of health problems, including headaches, neck and back pain, TMJ dysfunction, chronic fatigue, motor coordination difficulties, eye problems, endogenous depression, hyperactivity, and central nervous system disorders. Participants will be taught the detailed anatomy and physiology of the craniosacral system, its functions in health, and its relationship to the disease processes. Half of the class time will be hands-on, developing the sensitive palpatory skills needed to detect subtle stimuli in the human body.</p><p>Class material will concentrate on palpation and its potential as an evaluative and therapeutic process; fascial and soft-tissue release methods; and the pressurestat model, which explains the mechanism of the craniosacral system. Participants will be taught a ten-step protocol for evaluation and treatment of the entire body. By the end of this intensive program, participants should be able to identify and localize significant restrictions and imbalances in the craniosacral system.</p><p>Introductory level training.

Everything in our universe is made up of energy and vibrations. We are constantly interacting with the people, places, and things around us through our own personal vibrational field. If we choose, we can transform our vibrations to match our most authentic selves and become capable of so much more.</p><p>By creating daily health and wellness practices, you will clear stress and tension to heal and restore yourself — shifting vibrations to consciously manifest the life you envision for yourself and the world.

Individual small- and large-group activities will provide reflective and expressive opportunities to retool the myths shaping your life. Bring a meaningful but expendable totem, unsung story, or evocative song.</p><p>“Re-vision — the art of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of entering … from a new critical direction — is … an act of survival.

They travel and teach this approach globally, working with individuals, groups, and communities.</p><p>This in-depth program is for individuals, couples, and friends wanting to experience the practice of Gestalt Inquiry to support their self-exploration. Integrative Gestalt Practice is particularly helpful in life transitions and with vital questions affecting the quality of our lives and relationships (family, friends, intimate partners), careers, and overall life purpose. The powerful tools presented in this seminar can help support the emergence of what is most authentic in us and will continue to be helpful in daily life long after this week is over. The practice of Gestalt Inquiry imbues us with an internal sense of agency, clarity, and strength, connecting us to what many describe as a sense of “inner guidance.”</p><p>Gestalt places high value on the development of awareness. Working with individuals within the group setting allows all participants to connect and learn about themselves individually, shedding light on how they relate to the essential elements in their lives. Exercises done in dyads and triads helps participants “metabolize” their individual experiences, creating a powerful container for self-exploration and personal transformation. </p><p>Perry and Johanna will combine experiential practices involving breath, movement, and short guided meditations with individual “open-seat” work to create a well-rounded program suited for people who want to self-explore in a safe group setting. </p><p>We look forward to seeing you!</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/integrative-gestalt-practice-tm-052223" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Integrative Gestalt Practice™" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Integrative Gestalt Practice™" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a97265b1f46b874f01ece_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_23-Addison-Olian-north-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Perry and Johanna Holloman</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Integrative Gestalt Practice™</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">May 22–26, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">May 22–26, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">May 22, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">May 22–26, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Come home to your whole body instrument and discover your unique sound!</p><p>We believe singing and speaking are radical acts of self-expression &nbsp;and that exploring your instrument with full freedom takes tremendous courage. Science confirms what we see in our own experience — that intentional vocal toning creates measurable vitality and joy in our lives and empowers our whole body experience of life itself. </p><p>As your new brothers in Voice, we set a safe space for you to reclaim your power and connection to your body. The benefits are clear: Whether it be speaking at a conference, teaching a class, or singing in an arena, we see it as all one center of personal gravity, held deeply in the Embodied Voice you’ve been gifted this lifetime.</p><p>We forego performing and welcome experience as our methodology. We forego comparison and embrace an inner path to reclaiming a new relationship to our own voice as an instrument of our soul and a connection to both the Earth and the resonance of life. </p><p>So often, we are taught with the methodology of measurable results — competition and comparison as the benchmarks for success. Instead, this workshop lovingly invites you to take an entirely different path. We invite you to see that you are incomparable, unmistakable, fascinating, and wholly distinct as a voice. We welcome you to experience your soul’s voice through fun and embodied practices of self-expression, union, and communion.</p><p>In this module, you will identify the key elements of your voice and outline how you use your voice in your relationships, at home, at work, and in your community at large, and how you use it to set boundaries. You will become aware of your body as an instrument that was made to sing and immerse yourself in the music you truly love.</p><p>During this weekend exploration of your Embodied Voice, we set a safe space for you to reclaim your power and connection to your body through a series of practical and experiential practices that require no prior musical or singing ability. Through simple and fun exercises, we will help you ground down into the gravity of your whole body instrument and sound out powerfully what it feels like to be you and alive. &nbsp;</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/the-embodied-voice-052623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Embodied Voice" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6398d655b83ff935ab80750e_koren-brothers-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Embodied Voice" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a91d3679b627b62065240_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_20-Lodge-back-deck.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">The Brothers Koren</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">The Embodied Voice</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">May 26–28, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">May 26–28, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">May 26, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">May 26–28, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>What is vitality? Exuberance, vibrance, sparkle, spirit, and verve — terms rarely found in psychology textbooks. Vulnerability to depression and anxiety is widespread, and our culture traditionally emphasizes reducing symptoms with drugs that alter certain neurotransmitters, which is only part of the picture. We are living in a new era where vulnerabilities can become strengths, and what used to be stigma becomes common humanity. Good mental health is being redefined in terms of stress resilience, post-traumatic growth, and vitality.</p><p>This workshop explores evidence-based tools for living a vibrant life, even in the presence of stress, depression, anxiety, or any pain we may be carrying. We will help you build your own ecosystem of mental well-being — including new ways to foster vitality and purpose through caring for the brain, body, and gut. In this workshop, we’ll review the latest scientific findings on practices such as: </p><ul role="list"><li>Hot and cold exposures</li><li>Optimal physical challenges</li><li>Breathing techniques</li><li>Meditation</li><li>Embodied movement</li></ul><p>A mental health renaissance is underway.

Modern science is now reinforcing what ancient cultures have always known: We live in a vibrational world, a world of frequency. All beings are interconnected through vibrational frequencies, geometry, and sound. By using sound healing intentionally, we have the opportunity to aid in our own healing processes and embrace higher consciousness. </p><p>Working with the laws of resonance and entrainment, we will have the opportunity to experience how sound can calm our hearts, soothe our nervous systems, and align our brainwave patterns to bring forth greater states of peace, focus, and joy. We will use the seven main chakras as our guide as we explore the role of sound healing in harmonizing mind, body, and spirit.</p><p>Each day will include a blend of specially curated sound journeys, movement exercises, bespoke teachings, and experiential activities. You will also learn the basics of how to play alchemy crystal singing bowls and gain an understanding of how crystals have played and continue to play a role in evolution. </p><p>We welcome you to slow down, connect, and find the joy of listening to your soul — to feel empowered to bring new practices home and into our world.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/seven-wonders-of-sound-crystal-singing-bowls-for-chakra-healing-and-nourishment-060523" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Seven Wonders of Sound: Crystal Singing Bowls for Chakra Healing and Nourishment" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63d188360ca6d30bc2aaeabd_deva-munay-gold-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Seven Wonders of Sound: Crystal Singing Bowls for Chakra Healing and Nourishment" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Deva Munay</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Seven Wonders of Sound: Crystal Singing Bowls for Chakra Healing and Nourishment</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">June 5–9, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">June 5–9, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">June 5, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">June 5–9, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>We all have spirit guides. They are part of your soul family and spiritual GPS. Tuning into them takes patience, trust, and assistance from the Other Side. Learn to access your spirit guides in this kind-hearted immersion that welcomes seekers at all levels of experience and at any stage of healing. </p><p>This unique class dives deeply to understand and amplify the unseen support, healing, and unconditional love from spirit guides. Most people are unaware of the guides they are born with, let alone how to connect with them. Yet many of us have experienced a loving presence at critical moments of our lives or in our moments of serenity. What would be possible for your life if you could access that unconditional love, support, and guidance in a more dependable way?</p><p>This special and intensely personal class is designed for those who are ready to connect with the spirit guides who are always by your side, just waiting to assist, support, play, and dance with you. Connecting with your spirit guides is a profoundly intimate and expansive experience. Once this connection is made, it is forever — to utilize as you wish and create whatever you desire of it. </p><p>This course will introduce and connect you with your guides and set in place a framework to engage with them steadily and reliably. Each session is interactive and includes instruction and meditation practices to ensure that your experience creates the conditions for spiritual expansion. With support, you can better focus your energies to live an empowered, compassionate life that you love. The support and love available to you from the unseen world means you are never truly alone or disconnected. </p><p> </p><p>This class is for the moderately experienced spiritual seeker who is energetically sensitive, open, and curious to receive support from beyond the veil. Previous meditation practice is helpful but not required. This course is great for people who: </p><ul role="list"><li>Have a regular meditation practice and want to experience more active guidance and inspiration from the Spirit World. </li><li>Experience intuitive hits but get frustrated or doubt themselves because they don’t have the experience regularly. </li><li>Somewhat understand what meditation is, are clear there’s something beyond what we can touch, and are passionately curious to learn more.</li><li>Are in need of spiritual restoration and are ready to show up and reconnect with the most resilient part of themselves: their Spirit. </li></ul></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/finding-your-spirit-guides-building-a-relationship-with-the-unseen-world-060523" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Finding Your Spirit Guides: Building A Relationship with the Unseen World" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63d1891068f1e749ac8021c2_brenda-rose-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Finding Your Spirit Guides: Building A Relationship with the Unseen World" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/6387b17741191e3b8c365c75_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_24-Brody-Scotland-creek.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Brenda Rose</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Finding Your Spirit Guides: Building A Relationship with the Unseen World</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">June 5–9, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">June 5–9, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">June 5, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">June 5–9, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Doing personal growth work while still engaging in self-sabotaging behavior is like watering a garden full of weeds and expecting roses to bloom.

Looking back over the past few years, it is clear that many of us are exhausted. In times of turmoil and change, self-care and kindness are needed to connect us to the ability to recharge and renew. In order to move forward with energy, passion, and creativity, it is vital to seed these qualities in our daily life so that we may cultivate resilience.</p><p>Do you need to integrate more self-care into daily life? Would you like to be better resourced and have more energy? If the answer is yes to either of these questions, you are in perfect alignment to participate in this workshop.</p><p>The 5Rhythms is an externalization process that releases and balances the systems of the body through movement. It is a method of dance focused on presence versus performance. We pair this process with seated meditation to quiet the heart and mind, allowing for stillness and integration. Bringing both together mirrors the dance of life. We come together to create an environment that cultivates and nurtures joy, calmness, and ease.</p><p>Each session will be primarily focused on Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms moving meditation practice.

Beyond a mere passive appreciation of nature? In the long arc of human history, people across all cultures and traditions have lived in communion with the lands they called home. Though this intrinsic connection has been largely severed in our modern age, the perspectives and practices common to our respective Earth-reverent ancestors are not lost. They lie dormant in the land, among the wild beings, and in our own animal bodies, waiting patiently to be remembered and renewed.</p><p>Immersed in the beauty of the Esselen tribal lands now known as Big Sur, we will humbly walk the trails in pursuit of reunion with the wild Earth. We will set out each morning for hikes amongst ancient redwoods, golden grasslands, and fragrant chaparral. Our community and teachers will include the plants, animals, stones, and all aspects of the wild landscape. Acknowledging Big Sur to be the ancestral territory of the Esselen tribe, we will endeavor to behave as reverent and respectful guests on sacred land. </p><p>Along the trail, we will cultivate innate capacities for presence and wonder, build ecological knowledge, and explore pathways of reciprocity and connection with the natural world. Pausing together to learn from the land, we will participate in some of the most potent work of our time: rejoining our great family on this wild Earth.</p><p>Hiking notes:</p><ul role="list"><li>Answers to frequently asked questions about the workshop can be found <a href="https://www.wildtender.com/esalen-faq" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">here</a>. </li><li>Various hiking abilities can be accommodated, bearing in mind that day hikes are three to eight miles long with uneven and often steep terrain.

Our daily challenges and life circumstances are opportunities to learn — and we can alchemize our life experiences and emotions into greater understanding and clarity. In this workshop, we will bring together a variety of wisdom traditions and explore simple-yet-transformative practices to deepen the relationship between our bodies, our minds, and our aspirations. To clarify both vision and intention, we will weave together the theory and practice of the Tibetan-based Yoga of Renewal with the contemplative science of compassion and emotional awareness. We will also introduce a few of the codes of Andean Cosmology and transformative earth-based rituals.</p><p>In this three-day workshop, mornings will be reserved for quiet reflection to promote a clear mind of stillness. Afternoon sessions will foster intentional connections for awe, gratitude, and empathy with one another and the more-than-human world. While we focus on the experiential through individual and small group activities, we will lay the foundational frameworks that help enliven our sense of interconnection and resilience and remind us how to align our lives with our true heart’s desires and the ingredients of a meaningful life.</p><p>We will draw on traditional ecological knowledge, contemplative practices, and research-informed strategies to enhance purpose and manage emotional distress in our personal and occupational lives. Discover a cosmological approach to refine your intentions for your clarified purpose. Learn the tools that can help you re-envision your worldview, build resilience and empathy for stronger relationships with friends and loved ones, as well as unity with the more-than-human world.</p><p>Eve and Alejandro will be joined by guest faculty Cristina Lanata, MD, a physician and scientist specializing in autoimmune diseases. She immigrated from Peru and is currently a translational researcher studying how epigenetics relates to autoimmune diseases. She is also researching how biofield therapies can regulate maladaptive immune pathways, epigenetics, and outcomes in patients with autoimmunity. Cristina practices the principles of Andean Cosmology and Qigong and is a level one Reiki practitioner. </p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/the-alchemy-of-awareness-transforming-burnout-into-meaning-and-purpose-061623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Alchemy of Awareness: Transforming Burnout into Meaning and Purpose" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63d18cbeeb925919b8fffd4e_eve-ekman-alejandro-chaoul-gold-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63d18cbeeb925919b8fffd4e_eve-ekman-alejandro-chaoul-gold-circle-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63d18cbeeb925919b8fffd4e_eve-ekman-alejandro-chaoul-gold-circle.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="The Alchemy of Awareness: Transforming Burnout into Meaning and Purpose" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90172c86b76be6b9190f_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_15-Kodiak-Greenwood-lawn-garden.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Eve Ekman and Alejandro Chaoul</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">The Alchemy of Awareness: Transforming Burnout into Meaning and Purpose</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">June 16–19, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">June 16–19, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">June 16, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">June 16–19, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Our awareness of energy both expands and becomes more subtle as we deepen into relaxation.</p><p>The ancient Chinese practice of Qigong, often translated as “cultivating Life Force”, is a system of movement that relaxes and energizes the body/mind.

This week is an invitation to explore this map and unlock the unbridled joy, creative power, and freedom that lives inside of you. </p><p>The ultimate goal of yoga is to live in embodied enlightenment. It is to know and feel the current of<em> mukti</em> (the force of liberation that expands you in the direction of pure potentiality and higher consciousness) and to feel and celebrate <em>bhukti</em> (the gift of embodiment and all the pleasures and abundance of earthly reality). This workshop offers us the opportunity to bring these concepts into reality and into our living beings.</p><p>Through embodied ritual practices of yoga, live music, dance, meditation, sounding, and communion with nature, you will begin to shape an intimate connection with each of your energy centers. Together we will work to break through the blockages that keep you stuck and stagnant — preventing you from experiencing the fullness of your power and life. We will dive deeply into the chakra system through accessible, dynamic, and interactive discussions and exercises. </p><p>Each day, Cristi will guide us in her signature, dynamic chakra-based vinyasa, woven with mudra and pranayama, supported by the sacred rhythms and healing soundscapes of our musical guides. <a href="https://www.deep-la.com/" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">DJ Marques Wyatt</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dvine1" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">DVINE1</a>, aka Joel Long, will be playing sitar and percussion.</p><p>These practices will be enhanced by a variety of daily rituals, ranging from:</p><ul role="list"><li>Interactive lectures and discussions about each of the chakras.</li><li>Movement meditations.</li><li>Transformational dance practices, including The Deep Exhale Experience and JourneyDance.</li><li>Deeply nourishing soma practice and journaling.</li><li>Spending time in nature to activate our chakras through the five sacred elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space.</li></ul><p> </p><p>Join us as we turn the yoga dance floor into a ritual of self-expression.

We rarely allow ourselves the opportunity to stop and look at what is changing — or discover what we truly need to feel fulfilled. </p><p>This very interactive workshop will include lots of experiential exercises. Though we will cover valuable theory and there will be plenty of reflection time, this will <em>not</em> be a series of talks/lectures. There will be movement, coaching, a little dance, and lots of activity. All participation will be voluntary at all times. </p><p>Our goal is to step back from our lives and renew. We will create a courageous community to both challenge and nurture ourselves. Participants will have the opportunity to learn what brings them joy and purpose, and then cultivate a vision to serve as a foundation for both the next year and next phase of life. </p><p>We will engage in a progression of individual and group exercises focused on reflection, movement, and listening to our inner wisdom. We’ll discover how to navigate major life transitions and learn skills to access our intuition. We will uncover the behaviors that support our overall success, and reveal which ones undermine our goals and fulfillment. If you are passionate about having a more powerful and authentic impact on the world around you, this program of renewal will be especially valuable.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/designing-the-life-we-want-self-renewal-at-summer-solstice-062323" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal at Summer Solstice" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/639e13c0bd9fea2661f8db03_mark-nicolson-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal at Summer Solstice" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8d01346ec7b582715cfb_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_22-Kodiak-Greenwood-group-grass-oval.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Mark Nicolson</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Designing the Life We Want: Self-Renewal at Summer Solstice</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">June 23–25, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">June 23–25, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">June 23, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">June 23–25, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>This immersive week-long lab is for creators of all kinds––writers, inventors, filmmakers, musicians, and entrepreneurs––anyone who wishes to integrate their spirituality and creativity to tap into the deepest source of inspiration and higher intelligence as they bring guided work into the world.</p><p>In the words of Carl Jung, “People don’t have ideas. Ideas have people.” By breaking down this process of <em>allowing</em> into three stages (Creation, Manifestation, and Transmission), we will walk together along an impactful, sacred path designed for cohesion, connection, incubation, and transformation. </p><p>We live in a world of great distraction that doesn’t encourage deep listening. We must reverse those outer-facing sensory “searchlights” and go inwards. When you dive into the field of all possibilities, ideas surprisingly find you with a very specific intention. As you attune to that purpose, you gain discernment, direction, momentum, and flow. </p><p>Over the course of five days, you’ll face the “demons” that get in the way of meaningful work, including inertia, ego, outer blocks, and inner resistance. You will discover how obstacles can be an in your process develops organic, sustainable partnerships, growth, and co-creation.</p><p>In this workshop, you’ll be guided through:</p><ul role="list"><li>Nonlinear brainstorming to invite new and deeper relationships to ideas.</li><li>“Hotseat Exercises” and small group breakouts to foster vulnerability and creative risk-taking</li><li>Kinetic creation, such as yoga, meditation, and energy balancing, to increase attunement</li><li>Radical pivots and adaptivity to meet obstacles with poise and intelligence.</li><li>Case studies.</li></ul><p>Employing timeless principles from Vedic philosophy, this class will use nonlinear brainstorming to deepen our inspiration, along with experiential exercises. You will do yoga, breathwork, meditation, and movement to tap into the matrix of your creative capacity. You’ll recalibrate intentions and goals. Every step of the lab will contain practical solutions to push through whatever is in your way.</p><p>The lab is open (by application) to creators of all levels. You can attend either as an “incubator” (with a specific project or idea that you want to workshop) or as an “observer/participant” (to glean knowledge about conscious creation by watching the process unfold and also participating). In either case, you must submit a one-page application describing your background and creative goals. If you’re bringing a project to the lab, please describe it in one paragraph, tell us where you are with it, and where you want to take it. <a href="https://forms.gle/tcPLnFwzZaDyJUhEA" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]">LINK TO APPLICATION</a>.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/source-to-screen-accessing-manifesting-and-transmitting-great-ideas-062623" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Source to Screen: Accessing, Manifesting, and Transmitting Great Ideas" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63d6ad3a002ae50753190890_paola-di florio-peter-rader-gold-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63d6ad3a002ae50753190890_paola-di%20florio-peter-rader-gold-circle-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63d6ad3a002ae50753190890_paola-di%20florio-peter-rader-gold-circle.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Source to Screen: Accessing, Manifesting, and Transmitting Great Ideas" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a8da25fd2fd60e08559e5_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_13-Kodiak-Greenwood-tree-spiral.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Paola di Florio and Peter Rader</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Source to Screen: Accessing, Manifesting, and Transmitting Great Ideas</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">June 26–30, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">June 26–30, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">June 26, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">June 26–30, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Now more than ever, it is important we build practices to strengthen our internal resolve and self-resourcing amidst a dynamically shifting society.

In this workshop, we aim to individually and collectively understand <em>maṇḍalas</em> and related sacred shapes and their importance in Tantric traditions. Even the geography of Esalen can be perceived as a sacred landscape or <em>maṇḍala</em>. Our focus here will be on the historical development of the <em>maṇḍala </em>and its connecting link between the internal and external worlds.</p><p>Join Tantric scholar-practitioners Sravana Borkataky-Varma and Keith Cantú for this fascinating new workshop, the third of a signature series on Tantra, to explore the foundations of Tantric theory and practice. Together, we will investigate the latest findings from academic research and ethnographic “participant-observation” that challenge and reframe our conventional understandings of what Tantra was, is, and can be. Staying true to the roots of Esalen, we will intertwine our research and discussion with authentic Indian folk music performances and guided meditations to bring these new breakthroughs creatively to life in your mind, body, and heart. Our collective practice of these new understandings will illuminate Tantra’s connections to a wide variety of vibrant artistic and meditative practices in an eye-opening and unforgettable way.</p><p>In this workshop, you’ll be invited to:</p><ul role="list"><li>Develop an understanding of what a <em>maṇḍala</em> is and how to use it to journey to various points in meditation and on your personal path.</li><li>Learn to communicate your personal practice to friends and family using your new academic, researched-based understanding.</li><li>Creatively explore your divine potential.</li><li>Enjoy the benefit of overcoming negative projections and self-generated illusions.</li><li>Learn practical modes of meditation, including internal visualization and externalization of <em>maṇḍalas</em>.</li><li>Understand the connections of Tantra to art and music, and see a broader continuum of its relevance in daily life.</li></ul><p>Come to learn how Tantric teachings navigate the interrelationships between the microcosm, or individual, and the macrocosm, or external universe. We’ll pay special attention to the ways deities are called to inhabit <em>maṇḍala </em>and other diagrams, as well as the connection between deities and the power of speech using mantra. We invite you to join us for this workshop that will blend meditation, art, and music with a holistic inquiry into Tantra’s power and therapeutic potential.

Developing awareness of how our internal experience influences our relationships — and how those relationships transform us personally — can have a powerful impact on the quality of our lives and will be a central focus of our time together. </p><p>Perry and Johanna have developed experiential exercises supported by theoretical knowledge to create a well-rounded program suited for persons who want a month of self-exploration and also those ready to cultivate Gestalt Coaching skills for their work with individuals and groups. </p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/leep-integrative-gestalt-coaching-070123" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Integrative Gestalt Coaching" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 379.71875px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/63a0b12faff9ef2388eb09a7_perry-johanna-holloman-circle.png.png 720w" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Integrative Gestalt Coaching" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Perry Holloman and Johanna Holloman</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Integrative Gestalt Coaching</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">July 1–29, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">July 1–29, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">July 1, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">July 1–29, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>This weekend retreat welcomes couples across the spectrum of sexual orientation and gender identity — straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, or questioning.

That is why the practices they have created as a way to remove obstacles from their body, energy, and mind are suitable for us too.</p><p>These tools remained as secret recipes for centuries, and only in the last couple of decades have started to be known in the West, as they’ve been researched scientifically and practiced now by thousands of people. Those who practice them can discover or tap into a radical sense of presence — an aliveness in the midst of chaos — like a lotus flower coming out of the mud or the sun illuminating everything without bias.</p><p>Well-being in the Tibetan tradition is a holistic sense of wellness that encompasses body, energy, and mind. During this program, participants will have the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of Tibetan wellness and experientially practice meditative yogic techniques that utilize the healing power of the breath-energy (<em>qi</em> or <em>lung</em> in Tibetan) as a link and support for a healthy body and more aware state of mind. In addition, some of the current research in this area will be presented and discussed.</p><p>This workshop encourages participants to explore the potential of their subtle bodies — composed of channels and chakras — as a powerful tool for meditative practice, which utilizes the five breath-energies present in yogic and medical texts. These meditative practices and movements allow one to clear the “poisons” of one’s afflicted emotions, become more familiar with the healing support of the breath, and be radically aware of one’s “inner home.” Please bring a journal.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/meditation-as-medicine-for-the-mind-tibetan-yogic-practices-for-health-and-well-being-072923" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Meditation as Medicine for the Mind: Tibetan Yogic Practices for Health and Well-being" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63cc62377a8d5253b66e8653_alejandrop-chaoul-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Meditation as Medicine for the Mind: Tibetan Yogic Practices for Health and Well-being" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Alejandro Chaoul</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Meditation as Medicine for the Mind: Tibetan Yogic Practices for Health and Well-being</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">July 29 – August 26, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">July 29 – August 26, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">July 29, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">July 29 – August 26, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Join Dr. Deborah Egerton to learn to lead from the heart and find your place in the great rehabilitation of our humanity through love, light, and connection. </p><p>The authentic self rises when we let go of the flawed dualistic mindset — that our feminine energy provides only nurturing support and our masculine energy is strength. Setting aside this binary thinking and these stereotypical roles, we come together to honor and explore the totality of energies that allow us to be our authentic selves. </p><p>Through guided exploration, participants will &nbsp;identify our three centers of intelligence to gain access to and realign with the heart center and step into their true power.

Messages of love and understanding have been replaced with self-preservation, isolation, and judgment — “me and mine” versus “us and ours.”</p><p>We will discuss how we have fallen into pre-programmed patterns of responses and explore the “roadblocks” we face in accessing the heart space. The unique approach of finding the root causes of our judgments, biased beliefs, and even inequitable value systems allows participants to apply what they’ve learned to real-world scenarios, take action in their lives, and lead with the heart to reconnect across any divisions.</p><p>Recommended Reading: <em>Know Justice Know Peace</em>, by Deborah Threadgill Egerton, Ph.D</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/leading-from-the-heart-090123" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Leading from the Heart" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63bf3c1e70bf9a40cd920903_Copy of Rez.supe Copy of Circle-Headshots_WS-Faculty_360x360px (9) (1).png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Leading from the Heart" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/638a90c977d1c756fa8c78cf_WorkshopLeadImage_Site_21-lawn-group-circle-aerial.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Dr. Deborah Egerton</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Leading from the Heart</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">September 1–4, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">September 1–4, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">September 1, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">September 1–4, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p><em>The hunger to belong is at the heart of our nature. </em><strong>~ John O’Donohue</strong></p><p>Many of us have the experience of not belonging — to ourselves, family, community, workplace, this earth. This disconnect expresses itself in a divided self, dysfunctional relationships and communities, and the destruction of the very planet that birthed and sustains us.</p><p>However, a sense of belonging and deep connection is the natural state of our being. To know and feel our belonging asks us to have courage, curiosity, and compassion. A deep longing calls us to risk intimacy, vulnerability, and a willingness to feel how life conspires to let us know our interbeing.</p><p>When we somatically know our belonging — experience it in our bodies — we engage in the world feeling supported and with greater ease and grounding as we face life’s challenges, joys, and inherently ever-changing nature. This monthlong workshop will be a whole-organism, experiential inquiry into what belonging might be for each of us individually and collectively.</p><p>Although not a linear path, we’ll explore:</p><ul role="list"><li>The intrapersonal — our belonging to self.</li><li>The interpersonal — our belonging to others through individual relationships and in community.</li><li>The transpersonal — our belonging to the “other than,” which is perhaps even greater than the human world with webs of communities.</li></ul><p>The group will discover and practice contemporary and time-honored wisdom traditions that cultivate belongingness, including:</p><ul role="list"><li>Contemporary psychology and neuroscience</li><li>Gestalt Practice in the Esalen tradition</li><li>Meditation and mindfulness practices</li><li>Aikido and Gestalt Awareness Movement</li><li>Direct experience of the natural world</li></ul><p>Special attention will be given to “what walks with us” in our daily lives as we weave together an eclectic and holistic experience. When we embody the birthright of our interbeing and the ground of belonging, life lives through us.</p></div><a href="https://www.esalen.org/workshops/leep-ground-of-belonging-an-embodied-inquiry-into-courage-connection-and-community-092323" class="workshop-item w-inline-block" data-feathr-click-track="true" data-feathr-link-aids="[&quot;61675c7ab9c04fa87a0917e6&quot;]"><div class="workshop-info-tile-div"><div class="image-with-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Ground of Belonging: An Embodied Inquiry into Courage, Connection and Community" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 42vw, (max-width: 1279px) 30vw, 380px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail-faculty"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/63cc6300b0c5607ac7d8e088_steven-harper-circle.png" loading="lazy" alt="" class="image-61"></div><div class="image-no-faculty w-condition-invisible"><img src="./All Workshops _ On-Campus_files/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Ground of Belonging: An Embodied Inquiry into Courage, Connection and Community" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail-p-500.jpg 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/602d8561ae2fe6ec8347c903/61a69b7c6bc165f5c44e20b9_Emma-Barry-DSC_6069_LEEP_leadimg-thumbnail.jpg 800w" class="cms-item-thumbnail"></div><div class="workshop-details"><div class="workshop-teacher grey-font">Steven Harper</div><div class="divider-gold"></div><div class="workshop-title">Ground of Belonging: An Embodied Inquiry into Courage, Connection and Community</div><div class="workshop-duration-wrap hide"><div class="workshop-date">September 23 – October 21, 2023</div><div class="workshop-date w-condition-invisible">September 23 – October 21, 2023</div><div class="start-date w-condition-invisible">September 23, 2023</div></div></div></div><div class="workshop-duration-grid-wrap"><div class="workshop-date align-center">September 23 – October 21, 2023</div></div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><div class="rich-text-block-3 w-richtext"><p>Together, we will enjoy giving and receiving therapeutic touch, moving in ways that free energetic flow, settling into silence, and laughing and connecting deeply with our healing community. </p><p>During the Streams of Energy month, you will:</p><ul role="list"><li>Learn to give a full-body Shiatsu session.
