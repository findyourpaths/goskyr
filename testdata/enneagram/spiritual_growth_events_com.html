During this free live training with Heather, you will discover:      What people often get WRONG about decluttering    How clutter impacts your mind &amp; body (research-supported)    The REAL reason you don’t begin, &amp; how to overcome it    Embracing the “less-is-more” mentality    A functional medicine method to create your clutter-free sanctuary    Why Attend the &quot;How to Live Lighter with Less&quot; Workshop  When it comes to your clutter...do you feel overwhelmed? Stuck? Do you get sidetracked easily?    When you look around your home, does it feels chaotic, heavy, and complicated?

About Your Host - Heather Aardema  Heather is a National Board &amp; Functional Medicine Certified health coach, as well as a Life Coach School certified life coach. She\'s a former clutter-bug turned minimalist and the founder of School of Living Lighter.    A former TV ad executive, she spent two decades convincing people that they needed the latest gadget to be happy.    Struggling to find deeper meaning in her job towards the end of her corporate career, she couldn\'t take off her extra weight, her home was cluttered, and life felt complicated and heavy.    Then, she discovered minimalism—the intentional pursuit of focusing on what matters most by removing the distractions that remove joy from life—and felt herself getting lighter by the day.    She walked away from corporate, embraced a new way of living, and today has helped thousands tackle their clutter, un-complicate their lives, and lose their excess weight (mental, emotional and physical) for good.  Heather\'s Story About the Physical Benefits of Decluttering  Heather knows very deeply and personally what it\'s like to have to let go of things that you love.    Close to two decades ago, she purchased a home that had been recently remediated because some mold had been found in the attic.    The sellers took $2000 off the asking price and she thought it was no big deal.    Unfortunately, it was a big deal and Heather developed numerous autoimmune conditions and CIRS.    Over the course of 6 expensive remediations she realized that if she didn\'t let go of most of her possessions, she would stay sick. So she tackled her clutter head-on.

 "description": "Discover a variety of customized tools, including shamanic breathwork, mudras, and guided visualizations...    For accessing the field of super-abundance — where synchronicity, flow, delight, and magic become part of your daily life...    As you co-create a new way of being and live your deepest desires.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Discover Your Field of Super-Abundance&quot;&quot;  For most of us, daily life can be filled with mundane routines that can leave us feeling burned out and stressed.    Have you ever wondered, “Is this all there is?”    You’ll be delighted to know that there are portals to a world full of possibility and serendipity, where your eyes and your heart open to the magic of life’s abundant possibilities...    As women’s empowerment leader Kenlyn Kolleen notes, while these powerful evolutionary times may require much from you, they also open you to new portals.    These portals — unique, personal access points you can create — lead to the subtle field of the non-ordinary, where super-abundance lives.    For you, the most effective portal might involve consciously breaking free from a scarcity mindset, living as your future self, or going into what Kenlyn calls “Zero Space.”    As she explains, super-abundance is not about “manifesting” something. It’s beyond the material abundance we’re familiar with in our 3D existence. Inspired by the 53rd Gene Key, it’s a field in which you experience synchronicities and opportunities that give you a whole new sense of flow.    Join us for a new hour-long event with Kenlyn in which you’ll learn how to access the non-ordinary in the field of super-abundance — where you can co-create a new way of being with the universe to live your deepest desires.    She’ll guide you through an exercise to discern where you’re shoulding in your day — merely going through the motions and ignoring your true desires — and help you create a full-moon mantra to empower you all year long.    This work is powerful for women of all ages, and is especially fitting for women emerging into the 50s decade and beyond, a time of embodying your most radiant self while activating your divine purpose as a powerful and wise creator of the life you desire.    As Kenlyn will share, you can choose to live inside this super-abundance, no matter what life brings to your door.    In the process, you can expect to reboot your consciousness, meet your shadow, and experience empowerment, authenticity, sovereignty, and truth through embodied awareness of unseen sources of power.  Class Topics for &quot;Discover Your Field of Super-Abundance&quot;  In this life-enhancing workshop, you’ll discover:      A guided embodiment practice for stepping out of what Kenlyn calls the “should” spaces in your life — so you can figure out what you truly desire    A full-moon meditation — a spiritual cleansing to make space available for the new version of you to emerge    How to experience the field of super-abundance, where you’ll experience serendipity — synchronicity outside of linear time    The difference between super-abundance and manifesting    How the full moon, the equinox, the wormhole (the time between two eclipses), and the beginning of the astrological new year can support your manifestation, planting the seeds that you’ll fertilize for the rest of the year    How you have unique and personal access points that serve as portals to the field of super-abundance    You have a choice between feeding the fear frequency or stepping into a higher frequency of super-abundance — where synchronicity, flow, delight, and magic are a part of your daily life. It’s where things just feel easier and more aligned, and you trust that the Universe is conspiring on your behalf.      Click here to register for free.      About Kenlyn Kolleen  Kenlyn Kolleen is a women’s empowerment leader and founder of The Evolving Sisters Network — a global community of awakened women, leading with their sacred power, freeing their voices, and restoring wholeness to themselves, their communities, and the planet.    Kenlyn’s mission to activate women as change agents emerged from her early life as a top attorney and Notre Dame law graduate, where her mastery of the more masculine expressions of success, status, and money led her to discover the powerful gifts of the Divine Feminine archetypes — reclaimed through deep healing and a potent sisterhood. For the next two-plus decades, she devoted herself to the call through founding and leading circles of women.    After her first spiritual pilgrimage to India that included a private audience with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, and her second — which initiated her as a teacher — her intimate, online spaces grew into expansive circles with international attendance and evolved into an emergent leadership platform focused on empowering a new paradigm of feminine leaders: The Evolving Sisters Network.    Kenlyn broadcasts a weekly Soul Talk: Live Your Dharma live on YouTube that uniquely blends the esoteric transmissions of the Gene Keys, astrology, and practical life wisdom. She is the author of two books: The Art of Turning 50: A Woman’s Guide to a Radiant, Authentic Life and Forever Blue, a children’s book about loving and letting go of a beloved companion animal.

 "description": "At a very early age, we are taught that we have 5 senses – taste, smell, touch, sight and hearing.    Most of us grow up believing that these are the only senses we have to work with when it comes to making sense of the world, and creating the results we desire in life.    But this couldn’t be further from the truth!    Register Here For Free.  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Unlocking Your 6 Extraordinary Superpowers&quot; With Mary Morrissey  During Mary Morrissey’s “Unlocking Your 6 Extraordinary Superpowers” workshop, you’ll discover:      How to fully harness the 6 extraordinary superpowers you were born with, but that 97% of us use unconsciously… and as a result of not knowing how to intelligently apply these superpowers, we create unnecessary stress, scarcity and struggle in our lives.    The reality-bending secrets that Andrew Carnegie, Napoleon Hill, Henry Ford, Eleanor Roosevelt, Walt Disney, and more of history’s greatest “dream-builders” knew – and how to apply them to YOUR life, so that you can begin living up to your fullest potential, starting NOW!    How to plug into what Thomas Edison called “The Land of the Solutions,” so that you can almost magically call forth the answers you seek in any given moment, and use these answers to move through any situation with clarity, ease and power.    The difference between “backward” and “forward” memory, and how to use the latter to free yourself from the painful stories of your past… and take a quantum leap toward what you would truly love to create in the areas of relationships, health, career, and time and money freedom    The one simple question you can ask yourself to alleviate suffering and UNLEASH the true, awe-inspiring power of your imagination (as you were meant to!), so that the Universe rushes in to support you and the fulfillment of your dreams    Plus much more!    It will help you to begin experiencing way LESS stress and struggle, and way MORE clarity, confidence, prosperity and freedom, in your life this year.

And, she’s also a good friend of mine!    According to Mary, in addition to our 5 senses, each one of us is actually born with 6 invisible superpowers that work on an energetic level to help shape our reality.    Unfortunately, most of us are UNAWARE of what these 6 superpowers are. We use them daily, but often UNCONSCIOUSLY… and when we do this, we generate a lot of unnecessary stress, scarcity and struggle in life.    But, once you learn how to CONSCIOUSLY harness these superpowers, your relationships, career, business, health and all other areas of your life will transform with lightening speed!    Register Here For Free.  How the 6 Invisible Superpowers Were Originally Discovered In the 1920\'s  Back in the 1920\'s there was a journalist. He was given the golden opportunity of a lifetime...    To interview the world\'s most successful people and determine why THEY could succeed where others failed.    What he learned was surprising.    He saw that the most successful people did two basic things differently than everyone else:      First, they didn\'t let their circumstances define their possibilities. Instead, they allowed their imaginations to decide what was possible.    Secondly, they learned how to consciously and intentionally use 6 of their God-given gifts to turn those possibilities into realistic probabilities. Then into reality.    97% of people do exactly the opposite. Most people use these six God-given gifts to create scarcity, struggle, dis-ease, and worry in their lives. Those debilitating experiences then become the defining *circumstances* of their lives.    They forget the brilliant imagination they had as children – a time where anything was possible.    The thing is, when people awaken to their natural innate superpowers, they awaken into the most basic of spiritual truths:    That we are NOT human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings playing in this human experience. :)  The Origins of the Word &quot;Mastermind&quot; Came From Napoleon Hill  You may have figured out by now that the journalist we are referring to is none other than Napoleon Hill. And his groundbreaking work became the best-seller &quot;Think And Grow Rich.&quot;    Did you know the word &quot;mastermind&quot; came from him?    Today, enterepreneurs use that word to describe networking gatherings where people share ideas, network, and collaborate.    Napoleon Hill gave it a specific meaning though.    To him, a mastermind was a group of like-minded individuals who shared their gifts and knowledge so freely that what they created was MORE than just new ideas...    They would create an actual energy, a container, an access point, into a &quot;mind&quot; that knew more and created more than any of them were possible of individually.    A &quot;master mind&quot; from which all those connected minds could create big things... create beyond what the physical laws of the Universe seemed to suggest.    That\'s not the only thing Napoleon Hill was known for.    He actually shared another technique so powerful, some might even call it &quot;occult.&quot;    (though anybody can use this next one without going to deep down the metaphyiscal rabbit-hole)    Hill used this special technique to train his brain to think like the brightest minds in the world.    He used it to discover answers to mysterious problems that were elusive.    What Napoleon Hill discovered was one of the most profound approaches ever created for transforming imagination into possibility, possibility into probability, and probability into reality.    So if you\'re stuck in scarcity, struggle, dis-ease, or worry, then this century-old secret may be exactly what you need, it\'s something you can use to your advantage.    Register Here For Free.  The Secret of How History\'s Most Successful People Solved Seemingly Impossible Problems  Whenever the most successful people had a problem that seemed impossible to solve, or they wanted to create something massive but had no clue where to start, the began by closing their eyes.    They would imagine sitting at a table with the the greatest people from history.    People like Marie Curie, Nicola Tesla, Eleanor Roosevelt, Albert Einstein, Marilyn vos Savant, Leonardo Da Vinci, Hypatia of Alexandria...    Or Abraham Lincoln, Harriet Tubman, Stephen Hawking, Helen Keller, Confucious, Lucille Balle, St. Francis of Assissi, Maya Angelou, and even Johann Wolfgang von Goeth who had an IQ of about 220.    Napoleon Hill and others would ask questions of their virtual counsel and see what answers came back. Often, the answers were quite unusual.    Some people call this a good use of imagination. For Hill though, he believed he truly was connecting directly with the intelligence of the people sitting at his virtual round table.    Whether you take a more &quot;occult&quot; view like Hill did, or just see it as your imagination, the results are the same:    Answers on how to transform seemingly uncontrollable &quot;circumstance&quot; into effective and actionable solutions that lead us towards happiness, abundance, and a more relaxed way of enjoying our lives.    The thing is, what I\'ve shared are just TWO of the many many possible ways we can tap into our inner superpowers. Intuition is another one.    That\'s just the beginning though.    That\'s just a little bit of what Napoleon Hill brought to the table.    But what about Thomas Edison\'s &quot;The Land of the Solutions&quot; that help you call forth answers?    Or the difference between &quot;backward&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; memory... including how to use &quot;forward memory&quot; to free yourself from the painful stories of your past?    And the one simple question you can ask yourself to alleviate suffering and UNLEASH the true, awe-inspiring power of your imagination?    The best part is, you don\'t have to guess at what those are. :)    During Mary\'s upcoming free virtual class, she\'ll share with you the &quot;reality-bending&quot; secrets that history\'s greatest thinkers knew – and how to apply them to YOUR life.    Discover how to unlock the 6 invisible superpowers you were born with.",

 "description": "Have you heard stories of a near-death experience (NDE) that completely changed a person’s life?        Or maybe you’ve had one yourself…        Whether you’ve experienced one yourself or someone close to you has, an NDE is a dramatic turning point that can completely alter the course of a life…        International speaker and bestselling author Anita Moorjani not only had an NDE herself, she now guides others to access this transformative wisdom…        Anita will help YOU access the gifts of an NDE — profound spiritual truths, unconditional love, and a “no-holds-barred” way of living that frees you up to authentically be your very best self — during this free online spiritual class.        ===================================↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️ ===================================        What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Discover the Transformative Power of Near-Death Experiences&quot;          Anita’s inspiring story of her 4-year struggle with cancer, near-death experience, and return to life  A guided journey to simulate your own near-death experience — and begin to release the beliefs and fears that keep you from living fully and joyfully  Why you don’t need to work hard at being “spiritual,” but simply to live as who you TRULY are — beyond the constructs and expectations you’ve taken on from your family and culture  How fear of illness and “being a doormat” for others can actually make you more vulnerable to illness — and keep you from embracing your authentic life and deepest desires          How the NDE Changed Anita\'s Perspective on Life        After literally dying and coming back, Anita viewed the world completely differently...        She viewed illness and her body differently; she KNEW she was cured, not simply in remission. And she KNEW it was time to remember her mission and follow her purpose.        You won’t want to miss this opportunity to receive Anita’s guidance to help you discover YOUR power to thrive in your purpose, access unconditional love for yourself and others, and increase your psychic abilities!        During Discover the Transformative Power of Near-Death Experiences (Even If You Haven’t Had One), Anita Moorjani will help you discover how to release beliefs and fears that are keeping you from living fully and joyfully… in an experiential journey “beyond the veil.”  How Anita\'s NDE Experience Can Help You Change YOUR Life  Imagine old hurts, anger, and feelings of shame and guilt falling away…  All the cultural conditioning — and any limiting patterns you’ve taken on from your family — are simply gone.    And in their place, you feel deeper self-love... a deeper connection with others... and you’re more FULLY tapped in to the wisest, most authentic parts of you...  Access to this state of being can happen during and following a near-death experience (NDE). It can be a dramatic turning point that can completely alter the course of a life...  What makes the experience of having an NDE so life-changing is that you realize you are and always have been perfect, complete, and inseparable from Source...  Following an NDE, the felt experience of oneness is imprinted in your body and in your energetic field, and can be accessed at any time...  You no longer question your worth or your intuition. You no longer wonder if your divine purpose really is  what you suspect it is, or if you can muster the courage to manifest it.  There’s no longer a fear of being “too out there,” or “unrealistic” in your life’s mission... and there is absolutely NOTHING standing between you and all that unconditional love and the simple joy of being alive.  The good news is: You don’t have to have experienced an NDE to access this state yourself.  Anita now guides others to access the transformative wisdom of an NDE — whether or not they’ve had an actual NDE themselves. This empowers people to receive the profound spiritual truths, unconditional love, and a “no-holds-barred” way of living, which are so often associated with an NDE.  Anita\'s 5-Step Process To Help You Experience the Benefits of NDEs Without Actually Having One    Your First NDE Journey — Letting Go &amp; Experiencing Your True Essence  Releasing Painful Emotions &amp; Energy Blocks in Your Body  Deepening Your Intuition &amp; Accessing Your Psychic Abilities  Deeper Clearing of Your Energy Field to Prevent &amp; Heal Dis-Ease  Integrating the Power of Your NDE, Sustaining Your Life Force &amp; Fulfilling Your Soul’s Destiny    ===================================↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️ ===================================  About Your NDE Teacher - Anita Moorjani    Anita Moorjani, an international speaker and the author of the New York Times bestseller, Dying to Be Me, and her latest book, What If This Is Heaven?, has a remarkable story.  After a 4-year battle with cancer, Anita fell into a coma and was given days to live. As her doctors gathered, attempting to revive her, she journeyed into a near-death experience (NDE) in which she was surrounded by unconditional love and deep wisdom. In this place, she was given a powerful truth: heaven is not a destination, it is a state of consciousness.  During her NDE, Anita was given the choice to return to her physical form or to continue on into this expansive new realm. She chose to come back. When she regained consciousness, the cancer that had caused her organs to shut down began to heal. To the amazement of her doctors, she was free of countless tumors and cancer indicators within weeks.  Anita’s NDE has captured the hearts and attention of millions across the globe. She has been a featured guest onThe Dr. Oz Show, Fox News, The Today Show, CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360, the National Geographic Channel, The Pearl Report  in Hong Kong, Headstart with Karen Davila in the Philippines, and many others.  Today, Anita, who lives in the United States with her husband Danny, continues to share her incredible story and lessons internationally. Dying to Be Me has sold millions of copies worldwide, has been translated into 45 languages, and has been optioned by Hollywood producer Ridley Scott to be made into a full-length feature film.  Prior to her cancer diagnosis, Anita lived in Hong Kong and worked in the corporate world for several years. She was born in Singapore of Indian parents and grew up speaking English, Cantonese, and an Indian dialect simultaneously.  Anita Moorjani Answers: What Is the Nicest Thing A Non-Family Member Has Ever Done For You?  &quot;I had end-stage cancer, which I was supposed to die from, and I healed, and after that I started to share my story on the internet. I started to share what had happened and somebody brought my story to the attention of Wayne Dyer. And when he read it on the internet, he read what I had written, and he actually told his publisher, Hay House, that they had to track me down and that they had to publish my book. Now, it\'s not as easy as it sounds. I was living in Hong Kong.&quot;  Watch the video to hear the entire story of how Wayne Dyer helped her...    Testimonials for Anita Moorjani  &quot;I have been deeply and profoundly touched by [Anita’s story], and even more so by my personal relationship with Anita, who came into my life through a series of divinely orchestrated coincidences.&quot; — Dr. Wayne W. Dyer  &quot;Anita’s story opened my mind just a little bit more, another brick in building that wall of strength, and I can take her learnings with me on my own journey. I recommend that you do the same.&quot; — Rachel Bell  &quot;Describing her ensuing near-death experience as a realm of clarity and expansiveness, “a state of being,” Moorjani made the choice to return, and her rapid and remarkable recovery defies all medical understanding. Her psychospiritual healing, which continues to this day, was self-realization: of her own magnificence, of oneness with universal energy... Her candid memoir is a cathartic testimony to the magnificence and healing capacity of every human being.&quot; — Publishers Weekly  &quot;Anita reminded me how important it is to live life from a place of passion rather than from a place of fear. No matter what challenge life gives us, it’s really important to look for the gift in it.&quot; — Celine, Vibrant Living With Celine  &quot;I had the pleasure of reading Anita’s book after hearing her speak. Her near-death experience is profound. The wisdom she shares is life-changing.&quot; — Cheryl Richardson  ===================================↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️ ===================================        Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "Experience the promise of physical and emotional freedom with the Kinēsa process. Through liberating the trapped emotional habits you carry, you’ll begin a somatic journey to enhance your physical health, emotional life, mental acuity, and spiritual practice — and help others do the same.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;The Kinēsa Process - Move Into Your Freedom&quot;  What if your hip pain was actually a story crying out to be heard?    And what if opening to and understanding that story was the key to your bodily liberation?    Somatic practitioners have long known that our most primal emotions often become trapped within us — and become stories connected to particular parts of the body.    For example, the hips are where we hide some of our deepest emotions — sometimes even from ourselves.    Fear or anxiety can translate into a physical protective reflex in the hip flexors, while grief can cause you to pull inward and contract this area without realizing it. What’s more, shock can result in a rigid or “frozen” hip and pelvis area — and through compensation can impact other areas of your body.    By bringing fluidity and movement back into your hip area with gentle, focused movements, you can :      Greatly reduce pain and tension    Improve flexibility and balance    Live your life to its highest potential    The same is true with EVERY other part of your body. Your body has an unlimited range of ways to tell its deeper stories — and when you learn to listen and move in new ways, you open a brand-new dialogue with your subconscious and your soul.

 "description": "Are you fed up with the never-ending loop of taking coaching training after coaching training and making little progress?    Well, now is the time to end that cycle.    Lion Goodman, the trainer of elite Transformational coaches, has been coaching in one form or another for more than thirty years. He has made many mistakes along the way.    It took him far longer than it should have to create a successful coaching practice – and he doesn’t want you to make the same mistakes.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;How to Become a World Class Transformational Coach&quot;  Lion figured out two Success Accelerators that are pivotal to collapsing time and creating success quicker:  Success Accelerator #1: Become the best at what you do – quickly.  When you are known as the best, and you produce real transformation (as opposed to just information), word spreads FAST and you become the go-to coach for those who want to make big changes in their life (i.e., the BEST kind of client). When you’re that popular, you can command double or triple the rates that others charge. When you’re in a league of your own, others can’t compete for that spot. This is what Warren Buffett calls \'building a moat\' to stop competitors taking your clients from you.  Success Accelerator #2: Connect with people who are already successful and are looking to be the best, or stay ahead of the rest.  These folks are the most fun to work with, they have money to invest in your services, and they often get the most spectacular results. Why? Because they know they need to invest in themselves to keep improving. You may be thinking, “If they’re already successful, why would they need me?” Well, every single one of us (including Lion) has barriers, blocks and negative patterns that prevent us from reaching our next level. He has worked with millionaires who still have father or mother issues. Once we got to the root of their suffering and cleared it, every area of their life improved. Their personal relationships and their work life came into balance and harmony. When you can do this for high performers, you become known as an extremely valuable resource – and you’ll be rewarded handsomely.  Class Topics for &quot;How to Become a World Class Transformational Coach&quot;  During this free online masterclass for conscious / spiritual coaches, Lion is going to show you:      How to become admired, respected and known as the ‘fixer’ of problems among your friends, family, peers and clients    A proven model for becoming a World Class Transformational Coach    How to go DEEP rapidly and effectively, making you seem like a superhero    How to get to the root of any persisting problem and change it PERMANENTLY    Why most coaching models only scratch the surface of transformation, leaving clients stuck    Why resolving your own blocks first will lead to exponential growth for you and your clients    The type of client you should work with to get paid what you’re worth and build a 6-figure business    If you are ready to stake your claim as World Class, and build wealth and freedom for yourself, click the link below to register:    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Creating Profound &amp; Lasting Transformation For Your Clients  The most fundamental principle in economics is supply-and-demand.    If the demand is high and there’s a small supply, the price will be higher.    If the supply gets higher and the demand stays the same, the price will go down.    In a recent conversation with the trainer of elite Transformational Coaches, Lion Goodman, he explained to me the following:  “In the coaching industry, there’s an over-supply of average coaches. Thousands of people have gotten into the game, but most of them have been trained with average technology. They’ve been trained to ask questions that elicit information or wisdom from their client. That’s helpful, but it’s not what most people are looking for. They want true transformation in their life.”  What Does It Mean To Actually &quot;Transform&quot; A Client\'s Life?  It means a profound, complete inner shift:      From feeling, “I’m not worthy,” to feeling bold, empowered and confident    From reacting with destructive patterns with others (such as angry outbursts or withdrawal) to remaining fully present, calm and empathetic.    From resisting doing vital business tasks (procrastinating) to becoming highly productive and scaling your business to 6- or 7-figures.    These are examples of true transformation that lead to permanent life-changing results. This is what Lion trains people to do.  Where Traditional Coaching Approaches Often Fall Short  Most coaches are trained to ask questions and do a few surface-level processes. This keeps their clients trapped in the slow lane for growth.    Worse, some coaches take their clients down one of many wrong paths. For example, there’s the “just do it” school of will-based action-taking, which makes clients feel shame when they can’t “just do it” because of old beliefs, wounds, or traumas.    The unfortunate epidemic in our industry is that average coaches are everywhere, and there aren’t nearly enough World Class coaches to serve the highly motivated people who are looking for a top-notch coach who can create transformational experiences in every session.    You see, for world class coaches - there is massive, almost unlimited demand for their services but very little supply of them available. There might be one outstanding coach for every 100 high-performing people that need a World Class transformational coach.  Benefits of Having &quot;World-Class&quot; Transformational Coaching Skills  This means that if you have World-Class skills, you’ll:      Have more than enough people to work with for the rest of your career    Be paid tens of thousands for working with each client instead of hundreds    The Keys to Becoming a &quot;World Class&quot; Transformational Coach  The key to becoming “one of THOSE people” is to:      Learn the skills of creating transformational experience    Reach out to high achievers    Know how to market your services at that level    Deliver high-quality coaching that makes a huge difference, allowing high achievers to achieve even more    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  The Negative Impacts of Mediocre Coaching  Lion Goodman has been coaching for the last 30 years recently has been exploring how the coaching industry is in a real pickle right now.    There are dozens of coaching programs churning out mediocre to average coaches, which is tarnishing the reputation of the industry. That says nothing about the good intentions of the schools or the coaches who attend them. They are all sincere in their desire to help their clients, and improve their skills.    Today, though, the world needs highly skilled coaches who can go further and deeper than standard coaching methodologies. The industry made a real error when it declared: “We don’t deal with the past. We only focus on the present and the future. We leave the past to psychotherapists and psychologists.”    This artificial distinction robbed the coaching industry of the power to truly transform people and free them from their limiting beliefs, traumas, and wounds of the past. It has prevented coaches from dealing with the core issues that are preventing them from fulfilling their true potential.    Why is he saying this?  The Profound Benefits of Effective Transformational Coaching  After decades of coaching, he has seen the profound difference that transformational coaching can make. For example:      Fundamental shifts in identity, ability, creativity, and action.    Freedom from the burdens of the past.    Clarity, motivation and ease when the “buts” and “can’ts” get cleared out of the way.    Exponential growth    Increase in personal power    Greater capacity &amp; ability to get things done    Why You Should Attend &quot;How to Become A World-Class Transformational Coach&quot;  You’ll learn about a proven method to take your clients from uncomfortably stuck and confused to free, clear, focused and confident. It’s a synthesis of the most effective transformational tools he has gathered and used during the past 40 years.    This means no more surface-level coaching, hoping it works.    Instead you’ll learn how to dive deeply into the subconscious mind and create rapid, permanent shifts in the psyche. It’s hero-level impact – both for the client and for your reputation.    You’ll also learn about a method for finding ideal clients so you can build a thriving six-figure practice.    If you’re ready to become world class, and deliver world-class transformation to your clients, attend this free masterclass. You’ll learn how it works, why it works, and how it will impact your life and your clients’ lives.  The Two Tools You\'ll Learn About  Tool #1:: Identify the Belief at the Core of the Issue  Underneath every major problem in life, there’s a deep core belief that operates as the ultimate cause of the issue.    Learn a potent method of uncovering these hidden beliefs. When you discover them, your client can awaken to exactly what’s been holding them back, creating an opening and leverage for true healing and transformation.  Tool #2: The Body as a Doorway to the Subconscious  This simple embodied mindfulness technique rapidly shifts your client from their intellect to their feelings.    Like a magic wand, this simple process can relieve stress and upset, eliminate uncomfortable feelings, and open a path to healing. It’s a direct route into your client’s subconscious mind.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why the Clear Beliefs Method Works  Subconscious limiting beliefs are the #1 barrier to accomplishing your goals and achieving success. Until now, most belief-change technologies have proved to be only partially effective, producing temporary relief.    Why?    Because beliefs are made from experiences, and experience is multidimensional. To be complete, a belief clearing technology must also be multidimensional. The Clear Beliefs Method works with the whole self: subconscious, conscious and superconscious; mind, body, &amp; spirit; heart, emotions &amp; the energetic body; memories, conclusions and motivations.    When an old pattern is cleared from all of these aspects at once, it goes away and doesn’t come back. We can then see the world (and ourselves) without filters or distortion. Life changes profoundly and permanently.    To unleash your clients’ passion and power, you need tools to expose, explore, and eliminate beliefs, release internal resistance, and heal old wounds that hold them back. This is not therapy – it’s coaching at a therapeutic level – they kind of skills expected at the MCC level.    You need a deeply dependable set of master keys that can consistently and effectively shift the infrastructure of the human psyche. The Clear Beliefs Method, when skillfully applied, works every time. And the skills are learnable.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Free Gift for Attendees: &quot;Clear Your Clients’ Limiting Beliefs&quot; eBook  You’ll also receive a copy of Lion’s ebook, an introduction to the Clear Beliefs Method – taught to students around the world.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Facilitator - Lion Goodman  As a teenager, he asked the big questions of life: “Who am I? What are we doing here? Why do people do what they do?”    He studied everything he could about the brain, mind, body, and spirit, through psychology, neurology, philosophy, linguistics, history, and every spiritual practice he could discover.    At the age of 26, he was shot in the head four times by a man whose intent was to kill him. That near-death experience was profound. It woke him up, and changed his life.    From that point forward, Lion dedicated himself to creating success. He became an executive coach, headhunter, businessman and entrepreneur. He became a dedicated husband and father, and explored dozens of transformational tools to heal his inner wounds.    Lion used his research and practice to shape new, improved methodologies for deep personal transformation. Then he left the corporate world and dedicated his life to sharing these tools for healing and success.    Lion has helped thousands of people heal from their early childhood traumas, and eliminate self-defeating patterns. He is the creator of the Clear Beliefs Coach Training, which now has more than 500 graduates from 42 countries around the world.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "Explore the mysteries of the nonphysical universe and what comes after life in the physical world — including near-death and shared-death experiences, energy bodies, and more.    And learn how to overcome challenges and unlock your full potential using sound frequencies that help synchronize brainwaves.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Discover the Wonders of the Bi-Location Phenomenon&quot;  If you’re one of the millions of people who are curious about the nonphysical universe and the mysteries it holds, you’ve probably also wondered...    What happens after we die?    Would you like to find new ways to learn your personal truth about these questions — and use this truth to overcome various life challenges?    If so, you won’t want to miss this free online event featuring Dr. Scott Taylor, one of the world’s leading experts on shared-death experiences (SDE), energy bodies, and more.    Early in his career, Scott had no idea what an “energy body” was and was largely skeptical of anything related to metaphysics or “the paranormal.”    That would change — beginning in a crowded hospital room…  Forty years ago, Mary Fran, the woman he loved, was killed in a horrific automobile accident. Scott spent six days at the bedside of her seven-year-old son, Nolan, who was also mortally wounded in the crash and never regained consciousness.  To Scott’s astonishment, as Nolan breathed his last, he witnessed Mary Fran coming across the veil and scooping her son up out of his physical body. He was even more surprised when he could actually feel this exquisite reunion between mother and son. As Scott shares, “The two of them then turned to me, came over and embraced me, and then the three of us left and went to the light.”  The unconditional love that enveloped them was overwhelming as they were given time to say how much they cared for each other, and to say their goodbyes. At that point, Mary Fran and Nolan turned and went further into the light, and Scott came back into his physical body.  This phenomenal experience launched Scott on a multi-decade journey to understand more completely how he could have experienced being with Mary Fran and Nolan in the Light. That journey has evolved into his life’s work of providing people with the insights and tools they need to navigate the nonphysical universe on the other side of the veil.    Scott became a guide to help people experience expanded states of awareness, and served as the Executive Director at the Monroe Institute. He collaborated closely with founder Bob Monroe on the institute’s mission to help people create more meaningful and joyful lives through the guided exploration of expanded consciousness.    As a guide to the afterlife, Scott teaches curious people about common elements of near-death experiences (NDEs) and shared-death experiences, such as the nature of “the tunnel,” what happens during a “life review,” and how to reunite with loved ones.    When integrated, these extraordinary experiences can help you understand your life better — and even help you overcome challenges. Scott’s primary approach involves working with precise sound-based meditation techniques — using specific audio frequencies to help you tune in to these experiences, so you can effectively “bi-locate” by having one foot in the physical world and the other in the spirit realm.  Class Topics for &quot;Discover the Wonders of the Bi-Location Phenomenon&quot;  In this hour-long free online event, you’ll:      Experience a meditative practice to alter the vibratory rate of your energy body — taking the first step toward bi-location    Explore the secrets of the nonphysical universe and energy bodies    Understand the difference between near-death and shared-death experiences — and how they can transform your life    Look at specific ways you can find your own truth and overcome challenges in your life    Explore how each element common to both NDEs and SDEs — such as moving through the tunnel, reunion with loved ones, and life review — has a specific vibrational frequency    During this one-hour event, you’ll have the opportunity to explore the extraordinary world of NDEs and SDEs. Scott will also share more details of his personal story of how he became involved in this field, as well as his unique methods and processes for safely exploring the nonphysical universe.    To travel in the nonphysical universe and communicate with your guides, it’s important to match the frequency of the afterlife. To do this, you need to be able to alter the vibratory rate of your energy body. In a 10-minute session led by Scott, you’ll learn a 4-step process for achieving this.

 "description": "Discover how to harness and master the flow of energy to achieve the ultimate health, wealth, and harmony in EVERY aspect of your life. Join 40+ Top Experts At The 2022 Global Energy Healing Summit    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During the 2023 Global Energy Healing Summit  The concept of energy healing has long been dismissed as nothing more than an age-old fad. However, there is a growing body of evidence to support its positive effects on conditions like cancer, diabetes, fibromyalgia, and heart disease. In fact, energy medicine is already gaining widespread acceptance.    Why?    Because everything is energy, and energy can change, we will uncover:      Ancient energy healing practices with effectiveness proven by modern-day science.    How to develop resilience against any condition.    Simple energy healing methods you can start doing at home.    How to cultivate, harmonize, and utilize energy in a way that supports your wellness.    You’ll also discover:      The energetic imbalance behind your struggles.    How energy affects the different components of your health.    How to harness energy to create lasting transformation in your life.    We are all born with the innate ability to channel and master our Qi (life force energy). But most of us never learn how to activate this ability.    By raising our vibrational frequencies and intentionally managing the flow of energy around us, we can:      Achieve optimal health    Find success in life and business    Be happy    Improve mental clarity    Focus better    Create generational wealth    Heal past trauma    Eliminate stress.    Perhaps the most important reason to channel our energy is that when we become masters of our energy, we send ripple effects into the world. Every human who discovers their dormant healing ability becomes a powerful agent of change in a world in desperate need of healing, love, and peace.    It starts with you.    In our modern world, it’s easy to rely on technology, medicine, and science to light the way. Yet for thousands of years, we relied on our innate abilities to heal, grow, and find prosperity without any of that.    ✨ Energy healing isn\'t reserved for a special few...    It’s a dormant ability buried deep within each of us. All we need to do is reach inward to discover what we already known innately – we are made of pure energy, and it is entirely our prerogative to shape and harness it as we wish.

Start today by registering for this FREE 8-day virtual summit right now.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  5 Benefits Of Energy Healing      Good Luck    Overcoming Trauma    Longevity    Increased energy and vitality    Manifesting &amp; the Law of Attraction    Energy Healing &amp; Good Luck  Have you ever met someone who’s naturally lucky?    Maybe they ALWAYS find a great parking spot or can spot 4-leaf clovers without effort.    Perhaps they win all the contests they enter or seem to have good things fall into their lap all the time?    Want to know a secret? It’s not luck – it’s good Qi.    Qi – aka life force energy – moves through all living things. When your Qi flows freely, you can harness it and benefit from it. When your Qi is blocked, you’ll create “bad energy” and feel unlucky.    The good news is that you can learn to control your Qi and harness its power.    Discover the six most common obstacles blocking your Qi at the Global Energy Healing Summit.  Energy Healing &amp; Overcoming Trauma  Childhood trauma... Left untreated, it can dig into your psyche and drag down your energy and vibration levels for the rest of your life – sometimes making you physically ill.    Healing trauma might feel overwhelming, either because you don’t want to look it in the eyes or because you might not remember all of it.    But that doesn’t mean you have to live with it.    You have all the tools you need – right now – to heal yourself and find peace, health, and happiness. By using energy healing, this is true even if you don’t remember the trauma.  Energy Healing &amp; Longevity  Anti-aging is a multi-billion dollar industry – convincing you that to look younger, you need to buy the right hair care products, use moisturizing concealer, and lather on skin creams – one after the other.    And yes, these products can work – but they don’t address the real problem.    Real anti-aging comes from allowing your Qi to flow easily through your body – bringing balance and good energy    Discover how you can look and feel decades younger by harnessing and mastering your energy.  Energy Healing &amp; Improved Vitality  You know the saying I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired?    Being sick and tired is exhausting – but it’s NOT inevitable.    Very often, chronic fatigue, pain, and illness are caused by stress that builds up in our bodies and brains for YEARS – often from traumas and issues we’ve long since forgotten.    The good news? You already have everything you need to start the healing process.    During the 2023 Global Energy Healing Summit, you’ll learn from more than 40 experts exactly what YOU can do – right now – to heal that trauma at the source so you can see ripple effects in your health and long-term happiness.  Energy Healing &amp; Manifestation  Do you ever lie in bed – dreaming of what your life COULD be if you’d just quit that job, start that project, or chase that dream?    Do you watch people succeed – who aren’t any smarter or better than you – and think, “I wish I could do that…”    Do you feel like YOU are the thing holding you back from living the life you want and deserve?    If so, be sure to join the 2023 Global Energy Healing Summit. This summit will teach you how to raise your vibrational frequencies and intentionally manage the flow of energy around you to finally live a life in total alignment with your highest self.    This summit is for you if you believe that BIG things are possible when you learn to channel your energy.

Achieving financial freedom can feel so hard sometimes – especially if you have hidden limiting beliefs or subconscious fears that are holding you back.    These are normal thoughts when your brain isn\'t wired optimally for success.    Have you ever thought to yourself:      “When can I stop working so hard?”    “When will I ever have MORE than enough money? Instead of working and stressing endlessly for it?!?”    Or have you ever felt like:      There\'s a gap between where you want your life to be and what you\'ve actually accomplished    That gap can be so overwhelming that you feel like giving up    Only the “gifted few” will ever experience what it\'s like to be tremendously successful and wealthy    The good news is, it\'s not as far a gap as you think.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.    Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.    This transformative event invites you to expand your consciousness, discover ways to deepen your inner healing, and connect authentically with others on the collective healing path.  Explore a Conscious Journey through the Psychedelic Renaissance in this Immersive Virtual Retreat-Style Experience  Each day of the Psychedelic Healing Summit has been thoughtfully programmed to offer you a deeper understanding of the emerging world of sacred plant medicines and psychedelic-informed healing. Discover powerful integration tools to support you on your journey from the comfort of home.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  Daily Schedule for the Psychedelic Healing Summit 2023  Day 1: Foundations — History, Lineages, and Modern Science  Discover how ancient cultures have long used sacred plant medicines as powerful tools for healing and initiation — and understand how these teachings inform modern practices, such as psychedelic-assisted therapy.    You’ll understand how psychedelics are poised to shift mental health treatments as they move from the underground to legal treatments thanks to pioneering scientific research.  Day 2: Preparation — Foundations and Practices  Is microdosing the new path to healing? Find out on Day 2, which offers fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions — from the Amazon to the modern clinic.    You’ll discover ways to become your own best healer, explore psychedelics as an ecosystem, and understand how to respectfully connect with the wisdom of sacred plants — from living through dying and beyond.  Day 3: Ceremony — Rituals and Music  Experience a range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages to expand your consciousness, promote inner and outer healing, and awaken creativity.    Plus, learn to safely connect with the wisdom of sacred plants — without needing to ingest any medicine — through prayer, ceremony, integration practices, and sessions that bridge modern techniques with ancient wisdom traditions.  Day 4: Integration — Embodiment Practices  Explore the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, movement, and more as you discover tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    In our final day together, you’ll learn how to bring the wisdom of sacred medicine out into the world, including the emerging field of Ketamine-assisted psychedelic therapy and the role integration plays in helping to heal depression and anxiety.    You’ll be in good hands with summit host Dream Mullick, who has been in deep service of connecting the ancient and modern healing power of plants and psychedelic medicines.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  Select Speaker Topics for the Psychedelic Healing Summit 2023                  How modern and traditional psychedelic practices foster our understanding of nature, consciousness, and the cosmos with Dennis McKenna.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Narcissism has become one of the most trending topics of our culture...      What makes someone a narcissist?    How do you recognize narcissistic traits in others and yourself?    How do you have healthy relationships with narcissistic people in your life?    During the Narcissism Summit, we will look for the answers to these and many more questions surrounding narcissism.      Click here to register for free.      Why Attend the 2023 Narcissism Summit  From a Jungian perspective, it is recognized that we all need a certain degree of healthy narcissism. It is a crucial part of our individuation process that supports the discovery of our unique identity. However, this path is not without its challenges.

Click here to register for free.  Why Attend the &quot;Rewire Your Brain&quot; Masterclass  We have thousands and thousands of thoughts per day and research has discovered this alarming fact…    MOST of these thoughts are negative and are rooted in the subconscious!    This stems from past events, experiences, and even traumas.    It can also be a result of well-meaning caregivers who were trying to protect us.    One thing is for certain: when you have thoughts like, “I’m not good enough, I’m not capable, I’ll never succeed, I’ll never be healthy, and others,” those aren’t true.    In fact, it’s not even your voice. They are thoughts and paradigms that were taught to you over years or decades of conditioning.    It’s time to break free form these mental shackles that are keeping you stuck.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Rewire Your Brain&quot; Masterclass  Rates of stress, anxiety, and depression have nearly tripled in the last few years…    And rates of degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s being diagnosed in younger and younger people (some as young as 30), brain health has never been more critical.    If you or someone you know is dealing with any brain-related symptoms or struggling with fatigue, memory loss, or other neurological issues, then be sure to attend the &quot;Rewire Your Brain&quot; Masterclass.    See, doctors and scientists used to believe that once you reached adulthood, your brain was set, and there was nothing you could do to change or heal it.    Now research confirms that you can literally rewire your brain and optimize it for better memory, energy, and focus.    This is a process known as neuroplasticity.    Have you ever walked into a room only to forget why you were there?    Or do you frequently lose your keys or wallet or easily forget people’s names?    Or perhaps you often forget appointments or important dates?    Or you may get distracted by every shiny object and fail to complete tasks on time?    This can be frustrating and even alarming.    And you may even feel like your brain is broken, and there’s nothing you can do to fix it.    Fortunately, that\'s not what the science says. You can actually use simple yet powerful tools, habits, and exercises to power up your brain.    You can rewire your brain for optimal function and memory and reach your full capabilities.    And in the process, you can protect yourself from long-term degenerative diseases like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and more.    At The Rewire Your Brain Masterclass, you will learn the exact blueprint from the doctors, experts, and researchers putting this into practice for their patients and clients.    Here\'s just a little bit of what you\'ll learn:      How to FINALLY Overcome Negative Thought Patterns    How Stress and Anxiety Cause Inflammation and Impacts Your Health    How Your Thoughts are Keeping You Sick (and how to create healthy thoughts)    How Childhood Trauma Can Still Be Trapped in Your Body    How Even a Happy Childhood Could Include Some Trauma    How To Reframe Your Thoughts and Emotions to Achieve Your Goals    How to Face AND Overcome Your Deepest Fears    Top Habits Used By The World\'s Most Successful People    The Surprising Link Between Your Gut and Brain (and how to optimize both)    How You Can Easily Rewire Your Brain So You Can Be Healthy, Happy, and Successful    Simple Actions That Will Virtually Eliminate Stress and Anxiety TODAY    You’ll also learn how to protect your brain from chronic, degenerative brain diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia.    Happiness is an inside job, and this is the most important work you can do for yourself and your loved ones.  Click here to register for free.  Overcoming Degenerative Brain Diseases  Yes, these are very common symptoms, but as you’re about to learn, common doesn’t mean normal. The truth is, you can have a healthy and thriving brain well into your golden years.    Of course, the pharmaceutical industry would rather you not know that. They don’t want you to know that simple yet powerful techniques can literally rewire your brain.    They don’t want you to know that you can still have a sharp memory, high energy, and unstoppable focus and motivation, no matter your age.    They would rather sell you expensive medication that, at best, only covers the symptoms or, at worst, causes dangerous side effects.    There IS a better way!    See, there’s a process called neuroplasticity, and scientific research now tells us that it’s never too late to strengthen and change the structure of your brain for the better.    You can form new neuro-pathways that will even increase your happiness!    During the Rewire Your Brain Masterclass, you will learn these techniques from the top brain-health experts in the world. This 2-day event will have the latest, little-known research and protocols for your best brain health.    You’ve likely not heard most of what will be discussed in this genuinely life-changing masterclass, such as:      Causes and risk factors of degenerative brain diseases    Lifestyle choices to protect your brain health    Nutritional strategies for brain health, including a brain-healthy diet and supplementation    Exercise and physical activity as a protective measure for the brain    Stress management techniques and their impact on brain health    Sleep hygiene and its role in preventing degenerative brain diseases    Brain training exercises and cognitive stimulation    Natural remedies and alternative therapies for optimal brain function    Action steps you can start immediately to protect your brain from degenerative brain diseases naturally.    It’s time to take control of your brain health. You no longer need to worry if you or a loved one will have to suffer from a degenerative brain disease.  Click here to register for free.  Overcoming Fatigue  Fatigue continues to be one of the main reasons people visit their doctor. While there are many root causes of fatigue, one of the most common is also one of the least talked about: Stress.    You’ve undoubtedly heard of the fight or flight stress response, but it’s actually “fight, flight, or freeze.” An adaptive response we’ve acquired over time is to freeze or “play dead” in the face of stress.    This worked well if we needed to hide from a saber-toothed tiger, but in today’s modern world, where stress is a part of our everyday life, it can show up as chronic fatigue for many people.    If this sounds like you, you’re not alone. During the Rewire Your Brain Masterclass, 18 of the world\'s top experts on brain health, stress management, and energy optimization will help you:      Boost your energy levels naturally and sustainably    Overcome chronic fatigue and burnout    Improve your mood, focus, and mental clarity    Reduce stress and anxiety levels    Enhance your brain function and productivity    Protect yourself from degenerative brain diseases    Scientific Study on the Relationship Between Chronic Fatigue, Stress, and Anxiety  A recent study by the University of Bristol examined the relationship between chronic fatigue and stress and anxiety.    The results showed that individuals who reported high levels of stress and anxiety were significantly more likely to experience chronic fatigue than those who reported low levels.    These findings suggest that stress and anxiety can contribute to the development of chronic fatigue and highlight the importance of managing stress levels to prevent this debilitating condition.    The experts in The Rewire Your Brain Masterclass will teach you the latest and most reliable practices to easily manage stress and virtually eliminate anxiety so you can feel more energized, productive, and happy.

A Message From Joe Rignola    For years I suffered from debilitating anxiety and depression so bad that I didn’t even want to get out of bed most mornings.    What made matters worse was that, from the outside, it looked like I had a pretty awesome life. And the truth is, I did, for the most part.    But that only made it more challenging for people to understand and made me feel even more alone.    That was over 16 years ago, and not knowing what my options were, I went to my doctor, who quickly prescribed antidepressants–an SSRI (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor).  Things went from bad to worse    The side effects from the medication ended up being worse than my depression symptoms.    I was even more exhausted than ever. I was numb and emotionless.    My already horrible digestive symptoms got worse; I would get dizzy spells, and, ironically, my anxiety would sometimes be even worse, or I would get easily agitated.    My wife never knew what version of me would show up from day to day.    I was filled with guilt and shame, and I started to wonder what the point of the medication was.    So after a year, I decided to stop taking it.  That’s when the real problems began.    My doctor told me to take half the dose for 2 weeks, and then I could stop taking them.    I couldn’t wait to get my life back. Feeling depressed, I thought, was far better than what I was dealing with being on antidepressants.    But it wasn’t so simple.    The day after I stopped my medication, I was getting ready for work, brushing my teeth, and I felt my first “zap.”    It literally felt like sticking your finger in a light socket; only it started in my brain.    My knees buckled, my vision blurred, and I thought I would pass out.    My first thought was that my electric toothbrush somehow “shocked” me.    But then it happened again a few moments later.    I was confused. It was one of the scariest moments of my life.    It happened again the following day, and I knew the only thing I had changed was that I stopped taking the medication.    Now, this was the earlier days of the internet, but I found some information in a couple of message boards where people were talking about antidepressants and mental health.    It turned out that “brain zaps” were quite common when coming off of SSRIs.    I had to go back to taking the medication, and I was devastated.    It would take nearly 6 months of slowly weaning off before I could finally stop taking the medication.  Finally, hope…    While I was weaning off the medicine, I also started researching alternatives and learned that my diet and lifestyle were the most significant factors causing my symptoms.    After a year or so, my symptoms of anxiety and depression were almost totally gone.    Plus, I no longer had the digestive issues that plagued me for over a decade.    I had more energy than I had in 20 years, and I had even lost over 45 pounds.    I was so grateful that I went back to school for health and nutrition so I could help others along their healing journey.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

And it\'s time for us all to come together and experience the blessings of sacred plants and psychedelics and the ways that these powerful medicines can help support us in becoming more resilient, becoming more embodied, and creating together, co-creating a more beautiful future.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Through a gentle, and, at times, exhilarating form of somatic dance, she can help you touch into difficult feelings you may be experiencing — including  fear, grief, anger, shame… or joy that’s stirring beneath the surface.    Our emotions are meant to be experienced, expressed, and released.  Whether we deem them good or bad, it’s their nature to “move” us, and, for our own wellbeing, they should move through and out of us as well.    Scientific research shows that stress caused by pent-up emotions can contribute to many health issues, including high blood pressure, heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and even a suppressed immune system.    Bernadette’s own life challenges triggered a deep emotional shutdown and overwhelming sense of shame and discomfort around her body. It wasn’t until her daughter was born that she found the courage to turn things around and start the long and difficult journey back to her Self.    Bernadette followed the groove of her own drumbeat to reach the indwelling place of her truest passion: primal, natural, emotional movement through dance.    She’s a spirited, energetic, and fiery teacher, and the creator of the popular mind-body wellness program Femme! And it’s no wonder... she comes from a long line of natural healers who use touch and movement to help others find peace, empowerment, and wellness.    Studies of the psychotherapeutic use of dance show that dance promotes emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration, and can significantly improve your health and wellbeing.    During these turbulent times, we’re all bound to be holding strong feelings… perhaps some we’re not even aware of. And if you’re like many, you may even feel guilty about feeling joy in the midst of all the suffering around the globe.    Feeling joy is what you MOST need to be doing right now!    In her own journey of self-exploration and healing through movement, Bernadette discovered that this ancient form of self-expression can help break patterns of soul-stifling behaviors and valuing others’ expectations above your own.    Bernadette’s specific innovations in somatic movement and dance therapy can help you rediscover your primal self — perhaps the most essential and potentially most minimized factor in your personal freedom. Primal wildness doesn’t mean lack of control and unaccountable behavior; it means actually feeling alive — in a world that prefers tameness and sameness.    This is a form of dance anyone can do... drawing from your own inner rhythm — your Higher Self — as a catalyst for expressing and releasing your feelings that need to be released.    And Bernadette is a vibrant example of what’s possible for you. Her high-energy teaching style — using sound, beat, rhythm, and emotion — is inspiring and intoxicating. You’ll want to know her secret... to feel the abandon and joy she exudes... to jump right in and learn to better recognize and express your emotions.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  About Your Somatic Movement Teacher - Bernadette Pleasant  Spirited and energetic, Bernadette Pleasant is a fiery and sensual speaker, somatic healer, founder of The Emotional Institute and creator of Femme!, a mind-body wellness program, and 400 Years, a somatic-based anti-racism program.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

About Your Host - Heather Aardema  Heather is a National Board &amp; Functional Medicine Certified health coach, as well as a Life Coach School certified life coach. She\'s a former clutter-bug turned minimalist and the founder of School of Living Lighter.    A former TV ad executive, she spent two decades convincing people that they needed the latest gadget to be happy.    Struggling to find deeper meaning in her job towards the end of her corporate career, she couldn\'t take off her extra weight, her home was cluttered, and life felt complicated and heavy.    Then, she discovered minimalism—the intentional pursuit of focusing on what matters most by removing the distractions that remove joy from life—and felt herself getting lighter by the day.    She walked away from corporate, embraced a new way of living, and today has helped thousands tackle their clutter, un-complicate their lives, and lose their excess weight (mental, emotional and physical) for good.  Heather\'s Story About the Physical Benefits of Decluttering  Heather knows very deeply and personally what it\'s like to have to let go of things that you love.    Close to two decades ago, she purchased a home that had been recently remediated because some mold had been found in the attic.    The sellers took $2000 off the asking price and she thought it was no big deal.    Unfortunately, it was a big deal and Heather developed numerous autoimmune conditions and CIRS.    Over the course of 6 expensive remediations she realized that if she didn\'t let go of most of her possessions, she would stay sick. So she tackled her clutter head-on.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Experience the promise of physical and emotional freedom with the Kinēsa process. Through liberating the trapped emotional habits you carry, you’ll begin a somatic journey to enhance your physical health, emotional life, mental acuity, and spiritual practice — and help others do the same.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;The Kinēsa Process - Move Into Your Freedom&quot;  What if your hip pain was actually a story crying out to be heard?    And what if opening to and understanding that story was the key to your bodily liberation?    Somatic practitioners have long known that our most primal emotions often become trapped within us — and become stories connected to particular parts of the body.    For example, the hips are where we hide some of our deepest emotions — sometimes even from ourselves.    Fear or anxiety can translate into a physical protective reflex in the hip flexors, while grief can cause you to pull inward and contract this area without realizing it. What’s more, shock can result in a rigid or “frozen” hip and pelvis area — and through compensation can impact other areas of your body.    By bringing fluidity and movement back into your hip area with gentle, focused movements, you can :      Greatly reduce pain and tension    Improve flexibility and balance    Live your life to its highest potential    The same is true with EVERY other part of your body. Your body has an unlimited range of ways to tell its deeper stories — and when you learn to listen and move in new ways, you open a brand-new dialogue with your subconscious and your soul.    What decades of frontier work in somatics have shown is that simply understanding these ideas is not enough. By building an awareness of how you move, you can navigate any emotional and physical challenges that you’re carrying from the past. Unaddressed, these areas of constriction and pain become obstacles that prevent you from living your best life, says body language expert and Guild Certified Feldenkrais Teacher® Lavinia Plonka.  What the Kinēsa™ Process Is  Lavinia developed a powerful somatic movement approach that builds upon best practices in the field and her decades of teaching Feldenkrais to help you address any issue that limits your ability to live the:      Healthy    Pain-free    Joyful    Purpose-filled    Creative life    That is your birthright. She calls it the Kinēsa™ process:    KIN: Kinesis/Movement  E: Emotion  S: Sensation  A: Attention    Are you ready to take a deep dive into your somatic movement work to explore the upper reaches of your potential?    Are you a teacher, therapist, or bodyworker who’s passionate about developing your professional skills — and then transmitting and sharing this powerful new synthesis with others?    Join us for this powerful hour-long event as Lavinia guides you through an introduction to this life-changing work — and gives you a taste of the benefits that are possible by guiding you through a seated Kinēsa movement practice that uses Attention to transform painful Sensations and Emotions into freedom, flexibility, and relief.    As you’ll experience for yourself, unlocking the story in your hip joints and moving your body more freely also moves what’s inside you — freeing your body, mind, and spirit to do the great work of connecting to your highest purpose.    A trailblazing body language expert and Guild Certified Feldenkrais Teacher®, Lavinia is an Emmy-nominated choreographer, prolific author, and former artist-in-residence at the Guggenheim Museum.    Lavinia has helped people all over the world improve their movement, behavior, relationships, and careers for over 40 years. Her training and professional career led her to develop Kinēsa, which connects the dots between posture and movement, emotions, the mind, and spirit.    Join us and experience how Lavinia’s Kinēsa process can help you understand the source of your own pain — physical and emotional — and begin to release the emotional stories you’ve been carrying in your hips with gentle movements, self-responsibility, and self-care.  Benefits of Applying &quot;The Kinēsa Process&quot;  Join us for Lavinia’s first-ever public Kinēsa workshop — her unique synthesis of Feldenkrais, ancient wisdom traditions, mindfulness practices, and neuroscience — to:        Lessen physical pain    Cultivate greater tenderness and compassion    Attain clear thinking    Improve emotional fluency    Expand the sense of possibility for your life    Class Topics for &quot;The Kinēsa Process - Move Into Your Freedom&quot;  During this free online spiritual healing class, you’ll explore:      Lavinia’s powerful movement lesson, “Unlocking the Story in Your Hip Joints”    How your hip joints are connected to your most primal emotions — and how releasing these emotions improves everything from your posture, to back pain, to your overall sense of wellbeing    The relationship between your breath and freedom of movement — and how your posture, breath, and face send instant messages to your nervous system, creating the sensations that become your emotions    How you can cultivate an increased sense of freedom and energy with gentle, focused movements    A seated Kinēsa practice to experience hip and pelvis relief — so you can release and liberate trapped emotions, freeing yourself to move through the world with elegance, grace, and power    Ongoing Learning Opportunity for &quot;The Kinēsa Process&quot;  During the event, you’ll also learn about an extraordinary opportunity to participate in The Shift Network’s Somatic Movement Teacher Training Certification program with Lavinia, where you’ll take a deep dive into the Kinēsa™ process.    Lavinia will reveal new details about this certification program, including the extended 120-minute class sessions, integration sessions, assigned small-group cohorts, elective sessions, esteemed guest faculty — and the growing global Kinēsa community you’ll become an integral part of.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research. You’ll also be able to safely explore embodiment techniques and integration practices, and engage in revered ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices for deep healing and expanding your consciousness.

Together we’ll weave a safe and knowledgeable foundation to empower you to tap into your innate healing intelligence… expand your consciousness… and connect with your true self alongside a community of like-minded seekers.  Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.    Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.

I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Are you fed up with the never-ending loop of taking coaching training after coaching training and making little progress?    Well, now is the time to end that cycle.    Lion Goodman, the trainer of elite Transformational coaches, has been coaching in one form or another for more than thirty years. He has made many mistakes along the way.    It took him far longer than it should have to create a successful coaching practice – and he doesn’t want you to make the same mistakes.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;How to Become a World Class Transformational Coach&quot;  Lion figured out two Success Accelerators that are pivotal to collapsing time and creating success quicker:  Success Accelerator #1: Become the best at what you do – quickly.  When you are known as the best, and you produce real transformation (as opposed to just information), word spreads FAST and you become the go-to coach for those who want to make big changes in their life (i.e., the BEST kind of client). When you’re that popular, you can command double or triple the rates that others charge. When you’re in a league of your own, others can’t compete for that spot. This is what Warren Buffett calls \'building a moat\' to stop competitors taking your clients from you.  Success Accelerator #2: Connect with people who are already successful and are looking to be the best, or stay ahead of the rest.  These folks are the most fun to work with, they have money to invest in your services, and they often get the most spectacular results. Why? Because they know they need to invest in themselves to keep improving. You may be thinking, “If they’re already successful, why would they need me?” Well, every single one of us (including Lion) has barriers, blocks and negative patterns that prevent us from reaching our next level. He has worked with millionaires who still have father or mother issues. Once we got to the root of their suffering and cleared it, every area of their life improved. Their personal relationships and their work life came into balance and harmony. When you can do this for high performers, you become known as an extremely valuable resource – and you’ll be rewarded handsomely.  Class Topics for &quot;How to Become a World Class Transformational Coach&quot;  During this free online masterclass for conscious / spiritual coaches, Lion is going to show you:      How to become admired, respected and known as the ‘fixer’ of problems among your friends, family, peers and clients    A proven model for becoming a World Class Transformational Coach    How to go DEEP rapidly and effectively, making you seem like a superhero    How to get to the root of any persisting problem and change it PERMANENTLY    Why most coaching models only scratch the surface of transformation, leaving clients stuck    Why resolving your own blocks first will lead to exponential growth for you and your clients    The type of client you should work with to get paid what you’re worth and build a 6-figure business    If you are ready to stake your claim as World Class, and build wealth and freedom for yourself, click the link below to register:    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Creating Profound &amp; Lasting Transformation For Your Clients  The most fundamental principle in economics is supply-and-demand.    If the demand is high and there’s a small supply, the price will be higher.    If the supply gets higher and the demand stays the same, the price will go down.    In a recent conversation with the trainer of elite Transformational Coaches, Lion Goodman, he explained to me the following:  “In the coaching industry, there’s an over-supply of average coaches. Thousands of people have gotten into the game, but most of them have been trained with average technology. They’ve been trained to ask questions that elicit information or wisdom from their client. That’s helpful, but it’s not what most people are looking for. They want true transformation in their life.”  What Does It Mean To Actually &quot;Transform&quot; A Client\'s Life?  It means a profound, complete inner shift:      From feeling, “I’m not worthy,” to feeling bold, empowered and confident    From reacting with destructive patterns with others (such as angry outbursts or withdrawal) to remaining fully present, calm and empathetic.    From resisting doing vital business tasks (procrastinating) to becoming highly productive and scaling your business to 6- or 7-figures.    These are examples of true transformation that lead to permanent life-changing results. This is what Lion trains people to do.  Where Traditional Coaching Approaches Often Fall Short  Most coaches are trained to ask questions and do a few surface-level processes. This keeps their clients trapped in the slow lane for growth.    Worse, some coaches take their clients down one of many wrong paths. For example, there’s the “just do it” school of will-based action-taking, which makes clients feel shame when they can’t “just do it” because of old beliefs, wounds, or traumas.    The unfortunate epidemic in our industry is that average coaches are everywhere, and there aren’t nearly enough World Class coaches to serve the highly motivated people who are looking for a top-notch coach who can create transformational experiences in every session.    You see, for world class coaches - there is massive, almost unlimited demand for their services but very little supply of them available. There might be one outstanding coach for every 100 high-performing people that need a World Class transformational coach.  Benefits of Having &quot;World-Class&quot; Transformational Coaching Skills  This means that if you have World-Class skills, you’ll:      Have more than enough people to work with for the rest of your career    Be paid tens of thousands for working with each client instead of hundreds    The Keys to Becoming a &quot;World Class&quot; Transformational Coach  The key to becoming “one of THOSE people” is to:      Learn the skills of creating transformational experience    Reach out to high achievers    Know how to market your services at that level    Deliver high-quality coaching that makes a huge difference, allowing high achievers to achieve even more    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  The Negative Impacts of Mediocre Coaching  Lion Goodman has been coaching for the last 30 years recently has been exploring how the coaching industry is in a real pickle right now.    There are dozens of coaching programs churning out mediocre to average coaches, which is tarnishing the reputation of the industry. That says nothing about the good intentions of the schools or the coaches who attend them. They are all sincere in their desire to help their clients, and improve their skills.    Today, though, the world needs highly skilled coaches who can go further and deeper than standard coaching methodologies. The industry made a real error when it declared: “We don’t deal with the past. We only focus on the present and the future. We leave the past to psychotherapists and psychologists.”    This artificial distinction robbed the coaching industry of the power to truly transform people and free them from their limiting beliefs, traumas, and wounds of the past. It has prevented coaches from dealing with the core issues that are preventing them from fulfilling their true potential.    Why is he saying this?  The Profound Benefits of Effective Transformational Coaching  After decades of coaching, he has seen the profound difference that transformational coaching can make. For example:      Fundamental shifts in identity, ability, creativity, and action.    Freedom from the burdens of the past.    Clarity, motivation and ease when the “buts” and “can’ts” get cleared out of the way.    Exponential growth    Increase in personal power    Greater capacity &amp; ability to get things done    Why You Should Attend &quot;How to Become A World-Class Transformational Coach&quot;  You’ll learn about a proven method to take your clients from uncomfortably stuck and confused to free, clear, focused and confident. It’s a synthesis of the most effective transformational tools he has gathered and used during the past 40 years.    This means no more surface-level coaching, hoping it works.    Instead you’ll learn how to dive deeply into the subconscious mind and create rapid, permanent shifts in the psyche. It’s hero-level impact – both for the client and for your reputation.    You’ll also learn about a method for finding ideal clients so you can build a thriving six-figure practice.    If you’re ready to become world class, and deliver world-class transformation to your clients, attend this free masterclass. You’ll learn how it works, why it works, and how it will impact your life and your clients’ lives.  The Two Tools You\'ll Learn About  Tool #1:: Identify the Belief at the Core of the Issue  Underneath every major problem in life, there’s a deep core belief that operates as the ultimate cause of the issue.    Learn a potent method of uncovering these hidden beliefs. When you discover them, your client can awaken to exactly what’s been holding them back, creating an opening and leverage for true healing and transformation.  Tool #2: The Body as a Doorway to the Subconscious  This simple embodied mindfulness technique rapidly shifts your client from their intellect to their feelings.    Like a magic wand, this simple process can relieve stress and upset, eliminate uncomfortable feelings, and open a path to healing. It’s a direct route into your client’s subconscious mind.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why the Clear Beliefs Method Works  Subconscious limiting beliefs are the #1 barrier to accomplishing your goals and achieving success. Until now, most belief-change technologies have proved to be only partially effective, producing temporary relief.    Why?    Because beliefs are made from experiences, and experience is multidimensional. To be complete, a belief clearing technology must also be multidimensional. The Clear Beliefs Method works with the whole self: subconscious, conscious and superconscious; mind, body, &amp; spirit; heart, emotions &amp; the energetic body; memories, conclusions and motivations.    When an old pattern is cleared from all of these aspects at once, it goes away and doesn’t come back. We can then see the world (and ourselves) without filters or distortion. Life changes profoundly and permanently.    To unleash your clients’ passion and power, you need tools to expose, explore, and eliminate beliefs, release internal resistance, and heal old wounds that hold them back. This is not therapy – it’s coaching at a therapeutic level – they kind of skills expected at the MCC level.    You need a deeply dependable set of master keys that can consistently and effectively shift the infrastructure of the human psyche. The Clear Beliefs Method, when skillfully applied, works every time. And the skills are learnable.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Free Gift for Attendees: &quot;Clear Your Clients’ Limiting Beliefs&quot; eBook  You’ll also receive a copy of Lion’s ebook, an introduction to the Clear Beliefs Method – taught to students around the world.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Facilitator - Lion Goodman  As a teenager, he asked the big questions of life: “Who am I? What are we doing here? Why do people do what they do?”    He studied everything he could about the brain, mind, body, and spirit, through psychology, neurology, philosophy, linguistics, history, and every spiritual practice he could discover.    At the age of 26, he was shot in the head four times by a man whose intent was to kill him. That near-death experience was profound. It woke him up, and changed his life.    From that point forward, Lion dedicated himself to creating success. He became an executive coach, headhunter, businessman and entrepreneur. He became a dedicated husband and father, and explored dozens of transformational tools to heal his inner wounds.    Lion used his research and practice to shape new, improved methodologies for deep personal transformation. Then he left the corporate world and dedicated his life to sharing these tools for healing and success.    Lion has helped thousands of people heal from their early childhood traumas, and eliminate self-defeating patterns. He is the creator of the Clear Beliefs Coach Training, which now has more than 500 graduates from 42 countries around the world.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "Explore the mysteries of the nonphysical universe and what comes after life in the physical world — including near-death and shared-death experiences, energy bodies, and more.    And learn how to overcome challenges and unlock your full potential using sound frequencies that help synchronize brainwaves.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Discover the Wonders of the Bi-Location Phenomenon&quot;  If you’re one of the millions of people who are curious about the nonphysical universe and the mysteries it holds, you’ve probably also wondered...    What happens after we die?    Would you like to find new ways to learn your personal truth about these questions — and use this truth to overcome various life challenges?    If so, you won’t want to miss this free online event featuring Dr. Scott Taylor, one of the world’s leading experts on shared-death experiences (SDE), energy bodies, and more.    Early in his career, Scott had no idea what an “energy body” was and was largely skeptical of anything related to metaphysics or “the paranormal.”    That would change — beginning in a crowded hospital room…  Forty years ago, Mary Fran, the woman he loved, was killed in a horrific automobile accident. Scott spent six days at the bedside of her seven-year-old son, Nolan, who was also mortally wounded in the crash and never regained consciousness.  To Scott’s astonishment, as Nolan breathed his last, he witnessed Mary Fran coming across the veil and scooping her son up out of his physical body. He was even more surprised when he could actually feel this exquisite reunion between mother and son. As Scott shares, “The two of them then turned to me, came over and embraced me, and then the three of us left and went to the light.”  The unconditional love that enveloped them was overwhelming as they were given time to say how much they cared for each other, and to say their goodbyes. At that point, Mary Fran and Nolan turned and went further into the light, and Scott came back into his physical body.  This phenomenal experience launched Scott on a multi-decade journey to understand more completely how he could have experienced being with Mary Fran and Nolan in the Light. That journey has evolved into his life’s work of providing people with the insights and tools they need to navigate the nonphysical universe on the other side of the veil.    Scott became a guide to help people experience expanded states of awareness, and served as the Executive Director at the Monroe Institute. He collaborated closely with founder Bob Monroe on the institute’s mission to help people create more meaningful and joyful lives through the guided exploration of expanded consciousness.    As a guide to the afterlife, Scott teaches curious people about common elements of near-death experiences (NDEs) and shared-death experiences, such as the nature of “the tunnel,” what happens during a “life review,” and how to reunite with loved ones.    When integrated, these extraordinary experiences can help you understand your life better — and even help you overcome challenges. Scott’s primary approach involves working with precise sound-based meditation techniques — using specific audio frequencies to help you tune in to these experiences, so you can effectively “bi-locate” by having one foot in the physical world and the other in the spirit realm.  Class Topics for &quot;Discover the Wonders of the Bi-Location Phenomenon&quot;  In this hour-long free online event, you’ll:      Experience a meditative practice to alter the vibratory rate of your energy body — taking the first step toward bi-location    Explore the secrets of the nonphysical universe and energy bodies    Understand the difference between near-death and shared-death experiences — and how they can transform your life    Look at specific ways you can find your own truth and overcome challenges in your life    Explore how each element common to both NDEs and SDEs — such as moving through the tunnel, reunion with loved ones, and life review — has a specific vibrational frequency    During this one-hour event, you’ll have the opportunity to explore the extraordinary world of NDEs and SDEs. Scott will also share more details of his personal story of how he became involved in this field, as well as his unique methods and processes for safely exploring the nonphysical universe.    To travel in the nonphysical universe and communicate with your guides, it’s important to match the frequency of the afterlife. To do this, you need to be able to alter the vibratory rate of your energy body. In a 10-minute session led by Scott, you’ll learn a 4-step process for achieving this.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Discover the art of integrating your plant medicine experiences in a safe and transformative way...    Using a unique approach to shamanic healing rooted in the transformative power of love and prayer...    And activate your full potential and connection with the Divine within.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;The Integration of Love, Prayer &amp; Psychedelic Plant Medicines&quot;  Have you had psychedelic experiences that offered a profound glimpse of a more sacred way of being... yet struggled to bring those insights back into your daily life in a practical way?    For many, these profound experiences have failed to produce profound, long-lasting shifts.    Simply having more amazing experiences doesn’t necessarily change anyone for the better — it may just lead to addiction to experiences.    Instead, what if you embarked on your journey of working with sacred medicines as a prayer practice, one that is consecrated to the Divine, in service to your soul?    That is what Dr. Ali Maya offers: an approach to working with psychoactive medicines that is 100% a spiritual path — with every word, insight, and action infused with the intention that they contribute to the liberation of all beings.    Ali is a clinical psychologist, healer, and ceremonialist whose prayers have literally inspired thousands. As she likes to say, “It is ALL ceremony.”    If we approach the full journey of integration as a prayerful extension of the original ceremony, we no longer see the effects of plant medicine as primary. It’s the effects of our ongoing practice that ultimately spells the difference between an intriguing experience and a transformed life.    A lot of people in the psychedelic healing field talk about integration these days, yet too often that’s seen mainly through a psychological lens (as important as that is). We might journal, meditate, dance, or do art to help us stay connected.    Yet, what if you approached the entire period before and after an experience as a ceremony of prayer in which you are consecrating your whole body-mind-spirit to a new level of awakened depth, beauty, and love?    How might your journey of integration look different?    You’d use the few hours of a journey as a point of embarkation into your truest essence and authentic purpose — the ignition of your transformative journey of inner exploration and healing.    Stresses and tensions would melt away as surely as winter gives way to spring. You’d no longer be trying to keep up with the never-ending demands of a fast-paced world. You’d be living in a state of reverence for the Divine and for all of life.    From that state of consciousness, you could live with more sacred intention and holy purpose, laser-focused on what truly matters, while letting go of the rest.    This new life may not be what society tells you to strive for, but it’s the one that would feel most authentic to you.    Ali, who has more than 25 years of experience in world mysticism traditions, combines her academic training in clinical psychology, Buddhist studies, and comparative mysticism with the wisdom of Indigenous healers from North and South America.    Her passion for the alleviation of human suffering and the opening of the human heart has led her to create music, guide retreats, and teach programs that help create a healthier and happier world for all.    Ali is truly one of the wisest and most luminous and grounded guides to understanding how to work with plant medicines as a spiritual path.  Class Topics for &quot;The Integration of Love, Prayer &amp; Psychedelic Plant Medicines&quot;  In this hour-long free online event, you’ll:      Be introduced to the spiritual art of working with plant medicines in a safe and transformative way    Discover the importance of wise preparation, safe experience, and active integration of your journeys    Explore how experienced journeyers can bring their work with sacred plants to new levels of depth, insight, and healing    Receive insights into how to more completely ground, integrate, and embody the teachings of psychedelic experiences    Experience a safe and accessible ritual practice to cultivate your spiritual alliances with the healing plant spirits whenever you want    Ali’s approach to shamanic healing helps you discover your true potential and connect with your divine self, viewing plant medicines as beneficent beings here to collaborate in your own healing and the healing of our world.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Metaphysics for Healing, Self-Knowledge, and Manifesting  Metaphysics is the non-denominational study of “ultimate cause” in the Universe. One of the most basic ideas supporting metaphysics is that everything — including your thoughts and emotions — is created from vibrational energy itself.    Meditation, prayer, and visualization practices are great ways to tune in to the vibrational energies of the psychic realms, increasing your ability to perceive the unseen.    As you hone your skills to read and interpret these energetic pulses on your radar screen, you’ll expand your awareness and consciousness…    … developing an increased capacity to recognize and understand the psychic missives and intuitive aha! moments coming your way.    One of the most intriguing gifts of the 2023 Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities Summit is the invitation to more profoundly embrace your sacred, inner self…    … so you can receive and interpret the many loving blessings being gifted to you by the Universe throughout your day — and during your dreamtime too.    New avenues of scientific exploration are supporting what religious and spiritual traditions have hinted at for millennia — that it’s possible to receive clear guidance from the psychic realms.    By training yourself to enter an altered state of consciousness, you can receive subtle communications from weather, animals, sensations in the body, synchronistic occurrences, and other oracles.    Your awareness of subtle realms and beings —including totems, gods, goddesses, muses, spirits, elementals, angels, saints, avatars, and earth energies — is a powerful tool for healing…    … as you enlist the help of these spirit guides to support you, your family, your community, and the larger world.    A growing community of spiritual teachers and intuitive guides are exploring these ever-expanding frontiers, and we’ve gathered a number of the most prominent experts to share their revelatory experiences and insightful methods of navigating beyond the world we know through our physical senses.    The Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities 2023 Summit gives you access to methods for connecting safely and meaningfully with the unseen psychic realms. Prepare to emerge transformed — without fear of the unknown holding you back from accessing all that your intuition can guide you to receive.      Click here to register.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.

Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Awakening to a Miraculous Life of Love&quot;  How often do you find yourself holding back from fully loving yourself, your life, and others?    The truth is that we live in a culture steeped in fear. Polarization and numerous forms of hatred swirl around us constantly. For many of us, the natural reaction is to retreat, contract, and protect ourselves. When we are in survival mode and feeling vulnerable, love may not immediately seem like the appropriate response.    And yet, when we live in a contracted state, we don’t shine the way we’re meant to. Our capacity for greatness is directly connected to our ability to stand AS love and to truly love everyone, especially those who don’t express love. Hurt people hurt.    Loving ourselves and others unconditionally, is the only way we can effectively evolve ourselves and change our world.    The journey of greater love in our world, begins with fully loving ourselves in all of our messy glory. And then extending that love and compassion to everyone we meet.    Marianne Williamson is a living legend of love, having taught the spiritual principles behind a life of love for decades, touching millions of lives through her bestselling books, and embodying love in remarkable ways from founding leading social activist organizations to putting love into the center of how we live our lives.

Class Topics for &quot;Awakening to a Miraculous Life of Love&quot;  In this free 60-minute online event, you’ll      See love as more than a feeling — it’s an operating principle that can guide every decision you make    Understand how to incorporate fierce, passionate, and intense forms of love into your body so you’re never held back by a lightweight view of what love is    Receive transformational insights into how to dispel fear in your life so you can act in bold service of your highest commitments    Be given key principles to shift your intimate relationships out of negative spirals and into authentic love    Access actionable insight from A Course in Miracles for seeing and embracing the miraculous — to bring more blessings into your life    Practice a powerful prayer that empowers you to live your true purpose    Marianne Williamson has blazed an inspiring path for spiritual seekers around the world, showing us all how to put principles into action and truly walk the talk of an awakened life.

 "description": "Pain and loss are an inescapable fact of life. Whatever your age or income bracket, everyone suffers in one way or another. Experiencing the death of a loved one, a breakup of a marriage, or the loss of a job takes an emotional toll on us all.    Feelings can run the gamut from shock to profound sadness, anger, disbelief, or even guilt. Whatever the emotion, the trauma leaves an imprint  on both the brain and the body.    Trauma occurs when our loss exceeds our ability to handle and cope with what happened. The energy of the trauma gets stored in our body\'s tissue, causing a cascade of physiological reactions  that progressively erodes our quality of life.    The trauma created by the pandemic will reverberate for years to come. Many have lost loved ones, and all of us have been separated from one another, depriving us of social interactions and touch — and wreaking havoc on our physical and emotional beings.    If you’re looking to clear the traumatic blockages that attack your mental and physical health, register for this special online event with Giten Tonkov, the founder of the BioDynamic Breathwork and Trauma Release System. Giten is a pioneering trauma-release expert who has worked with thousands of people on five continents, helping them break the trauma cycle and lead more fulfilling lives.  ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    What You\'ll Learn In This Free Online Breathwork Class        The physical sensation produced by the body when your trauma is released      How trauma turns to tension and how it’s stored in the body, accumulating over the years      The 7 “Belts” that exist throughout the body — and how tension is distributed in particular patterns      The 6 healing tools of BioDynamic Breathwork and how this modality works differently than ordinary breathwork      How the heart, in particular, is taxed during these difficult times    BioDynamic Breathwork is designed to open up your heart so you can feel happy and hopeful again. It can help you heal and release core tensions  by working through and clearing repressed negative energy stuck within your body. You’ll use breath as the main tool for healing on the somatic level, along with supporting elements such as movement, touch, sound, conscious emotional expression, and meditation.    During this free event, Giten will also guide you in a seated breathwork exercise that can help you find a peaceful, safe place inside of yourself. You’ll travel into your body, unlocking the armor and releasing the rings constricting your heart, freeing the negative emotions, healing the physical ailments, and soothing the wounded ego. This safe space will remain a place you can go to whenever you need to open your heart to let your positivity flow freely.  You won’t want to miss this opportunity to experience firsthand how suffering can be released through breath and movement.  More than anything, this practice can help you summon the strength, faith, and courage to live your life happily, openly, and freely.  In Clearing Trauma Through BioDynamic Breathwork: Practices to Open Your Heart, Release Fear &amp; Find Emotional Peace, you’ll travel into your body, unlocking the armor and releasing the rings constricting your heart, freeing the negative emotions, healing the physical ailments, and soothing the wounded ego.   This safe space will remain a place you can go to whenever you need to open your heart to let your positivity flow freely.    How BioDyanmic Breathwork Helps Heal Trauma Caused By The Covid-19 Pandemic  Learn powerful breath and movement techniques to track the sensations in each area of your body, let go of trauma — and find the strength and ability to live your life happily, openly, and freely.  These days, many of us have settled into some version of the “new normal.” And yet, the turmoil of these times is always with us, impacting our lives.    Even as we become more accustomed to the uncertainty, though, the lingering trauma will have lasting impacts for decades to come.    Trauma is very real. It’s not just an idea, or a feeling of upset. It physically takes up residence in our tissues over time, expressing itself in our everyday lives, and it can last for years...    According to Giten Tonkov, trauma can manifest almost anywhere in the body, and impact almost anyone. Trauma is a physical reaction that becomes part of our bodies, a response to situations both large and small.    A traumatic event can be as simple as being startled by an aggressively barking dog, or as complex as suddenly losing a loved one.    It can also be the cumulative effect of long-term but perhaps less obvious stressors, like interpersonal difficulties, dreams that have fallen by the wayside, or generalized anxiety.    Trauma happens when our systems become overwhelmed. And if we can’t adequately process and clear the traumatic experiences, our lives can slowly become unmanageable.    BioDynamic Breathwork  supports your body’s natural process for releasing chronic tension, self-restricting patterns, and emotional trauma — clearing the way for feelings of joy, self-love, and deep relaxation.

Breathwork is one of the three most powerful tools humans have available to release the past and awaken our consciousness. It’s the deepest transformational work I have ever done! Great for individuals or practitioners to release deeply held tension, which saves you doing years of psychotherapy in just a few sessions, moving beyond the mind, to release and make room for more breath, life, joy, peace, and happiness in your life.&quot; — Eeshira Hart    &quot;BBTRS is nature’s gift to humanity. I am forever grateful to Giten for designing and sharing this method in such a heartfelt, sincere way... The work is profound and supports universal change. This is how I always imagined I could help others. And, I am awestruck by what it has shown me about myself. Through this work I have shaken and released emotional/physical blockages enabling me to fulfill my spirit’s journey, one that ripples out to affect those around me.&quot; — Michelle M.  ~~  &quot;Never have I grown as much as I have this week. We have worked to tap into the core of so many problems and the source of so much joy. This training has more depth than anything I’ve ever encountered. I could have lived the rest of my life on the path I was on, but since I have found BBTRS®, I have the chance to go so much deeper.    I have always felt so different and sometimes isolated for feeling the way that I do. Here, I feel safe to be different, BUT, also not so different anymore. I have found something that resonates so deeply inside me. Thank you... for touching this point inside me and for teaching me how to tune into myself.&quot; — Dr. Jason R.  ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Metaphysics for Healing, Self-Knowledge, and Manifesting  Metaphysics is the non-denominational study of “ultimate cause” in the Universe. One of the most basic ideas supporting metaphysics is that everything — including your thoughts and emotions — is created from vibrational energy itself.    Meditation, prayer, and visualization practices are great ways to tune in to the vibrational energies of the psychic realms, increasing your ability to perceive the unseen.    As you hone your skills to read and interpret these energetic pulses on your radar screen, you’ll expand your awareness and consciousness…    … developing an increased capacity to recognize and understand the psychic missives and intuitive aha! moments coming your way.    One of the most intriguing gifts of the 2023 Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities Summit is the invitation to more profoundly embrace your sacred, inner self…    … so you can receive and interpret the many loving blessings being gifted to you by the Universe throughout your day — and during your dreamtime too.    New avenues of scientific exploration are supporting what religious and spiritual traditions have hinted at for millennia — that it’s possible to receive clear guidance from the psychic realms.    By training yourself to enter an altered state of consciousness, you can receive subtle communications from weather, animals, sensations in the body, synchronistic occurrences, and other oracles.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Experience an auspicious inner state of gratitude, intention, and wellbeing through the ancient devotional practices of Vedic and kirtan chanting — to access fortitude, focus, guidance, and inner peace during life’s most challenging times.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;The Sound Medicine of Sacred Vedic &amp; Kirtan Chanting&quot;  How do you cope when circumstances feel out of control?    How do you sustain yourself and heal when events occur in your life, or in the outside world, that leave you feeling destabilized, afraid, or grieving — as if you’ve been thrown off your path with no roadmap to follow?    What strategies do you use to find your footing again?    According to beloved chantress Nina Rao, spiritual seekers have for centuries turned to the ancient devotional practice of chanting mantras to cultivate a powerful internal container — providing a sense of sanctuary and the kind of inner refuge we’re all longing for.    Even in our busy modern world, the discipline of a daily chanting practice can help you access this space of strength, comfort, and safety within yourself whenever you need to.    Chanting offers spiritual sustenance that feeds and supports you — providing inner strength and peace that you can return to time and again when life throws you off your axis.    Thousands of years ago, this mantra tradition was shared with all spiritual seekers. Over time, however, in an effort to suppress the masses, it became a privilege only accessible to monastic men. Our culture today is harkening back to the ancient roots of chanting to re-establish that Vedic mantras were meant to be available to everyone who wishes to undertake the practice.    Iterations of mantra chanting are found in the form of call-and-response kirtan, which is easily accessible to everyone and practiced all over the world by those who long to immerse themselves in the ocean of divine love through prayers sung from the heart.    Nina grew up in India and learned traditional chanting from her grandfather when she was just nine years old.    When she moved to the States, she met world-renowned chant master Krishna Das, and began chanting and working with him. Her own personal chant practice grew organically out of a natural resonance with music, mantra, and the Divine Feminine.    Nina draws on both her background and on ancient Sanskrit sacred texts to bring a unique perspective to her chanting and teaching... one that fuses East with West.  Class Topics for &quot;The Sound Medicine of Sacred Vedic &amp; Kirtan Chanting&quot;  Join her for a nourishing hour-long event where she’ll share the sacred practices of both Vedic and kirtan chanting, which you can carry with you into your own practice.    During this illuminating experiential workshop, you’ll:      Learn how Vedic mantras are precise and rule-driven,which helps you develop stronger concentration, deepen your practice, and honor the ancient tradition... compared to the kirtan that most of us are used to hearing (and singing!) in the West    Discover how mantras create an auspicious inner state of gratitude, intention, and wellbeing — a sanctuary for refuge and sustenance in times of duress    Hear Nina chant one verse from the Sri Rudram, the invocation of Rudra in the Vedic style — to cope with the karma of life and ask Shiva for his blessings    Sing Om Namah Shivaya with Nina in kirtan style — call and response — repeating the name of God to calm your mind, open your heart, and help realize your inner Self    Experience the dispelling of fear, and the peace and love that can wash over you as you chant mantras    Drawn from the highest authority in Hindu dharma, Vedic chanting is the practice of repeating a mantra in which exactness in notes, rhythm, and pronunciation is vital...    ... while kirtan, which evolved from the original roots of the Vedic mantras, is sung.    They both result in a state of wellbeing of your physical, mental, and emotional bodies, although the Vedic style guides you deeper into your own devotion.    As Nina will explain, knowing how to access your palpable inner haven can soften anxiety and inspire feelings of confidence and calm you can carry throughout your day.    Sustained practice will help you deepen your devotion and cultivate a greater sense of surrender, patience, courage, generosity, clarity, and wisdom.    Chanting helps you develop a loving heart of kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. As a form of prayer, mantras guide you to exercise your true free will, turning what can feel like helplessness into positive action.    With Nina’s guidance, you’ll experience for yourself the exhilarating truth that chanting is an expression of your own innate devotion.      Click here to register for free.      About Your Teacher - Nina Rao  Nina Rao learned traditional chants (bhajans) from her grandfather in a village in South India when she was nine years old. Her childhood was spent living in and moving between many countries around the world. Prior to rediscovering chanting with Krishna Das in New York in 1996, she worked in banking before switching to organizing and leading photographic wildlife safaris in Africa and India. For many years, she has been Krishna Das’ business manager and accompanist as well as a chant leader in her own right.    Nina tours with Krishna Das, playing cymbals and singing with him. In 2007, she recorded the track “Nina Chalisa” on Krishna Das’ CD Flow of Grace: Chanting the Hanuman Chalisa. In January 2013, she released her debut album, Antarayaami: Knower of All Hearts, which includes a duet with Krishna Das. Later that year, she was honored to accompany him at the Grammy Awards webcast performance. Her second album, Anubhav, released in 2018, was entirely crowdfunded.    For over 20 years she has supported conservationists in preserving the sacred wilderness and forests of India via her charity, Saving Wild Tigers. Nina regularly leads kirtan, chanting in workshops, festivals, and retreats in her hometown of Brooklyn, New York, and beyond.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Metaphysics for Healing, Self-Knowledge, and Manifesting  Metaphysics is the non-denominational study of “ultimate cause” in the Universe. One of the most basic ideas supporting metaphysics is that everything — including your thoughts and emotions — is created from vibrational energy itself.    Meditation, prayer, and visualization practices are great ways to tune in to the vibrational energies of the psychic realms, increasing your ability to perceive the unseen.    As you hone your skills to read and interpret these energetic pulses on your radar screen, you’ll expand your awareness and consciousness…    … developing an increased capacity to recognize and understand the psychic missives and intuitive aha! moments coming your way.    One of the most intriguing gifts of the 2023 Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities Summit is the invitation to more profoundly embrace your sacred, inner self…    … so you can receive and interpret the many loving blessings being gifted to you by the Universe throughout your day — and during your dreamtime too.    New avenues of scientific exploration are supporting what religious and spiritual traditions have hinted at for millennia — that it’s possible to receive clear guidance from the psychic realms.    By training yourself to enter an altered state of consciousness, you can receive subtle communications from weather, animals, sensations in the body, synchronistic occurrences, and other oracles.    Your awareness of subtle realms and beings —including totems, gods, goddesses, muses, spirits, elementals, angels, saints, avatars, and earth energies — is a powerful tool for healing…    … as you enlist the help of these spirit guides to support you, your family, your community, and the larger world.    A growing community of spiritual teachers and intuitive guides are exploring these ever-expanding frontiers, and we’ve gathered a number of the most prominent experts to share their revelatory experiences and insightful methods of navigating beyond the world we know through our physical senses.    The Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities 2023 Summit gives you access to methods for connecting safely and meaningfully with the unseen psychic realms. Prepare to emerge transformed — without fear of the unknown holding you back from accessing all that your intuition can guide you to receive.      Click here to register.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Scientific evidence has revealed that music and key sound frequencies have the power to support our bodies to heal naturally at a very deep level.    When applied correctly, these vibrations gently massage the body’s cells and have an almost magical capacity to heal emotional and physical traumas held in the body.  Health Challenges That Sound Healing Can Help With      Chronic pain    Chronic inflammation    High blood pressure    And poor immune system efficiency    Can all be alleviated without the need for prescription drugs, affirms acoustics scientist John Stuart Reid.  Why John Stuart Reid Teaches Sound Healing  After prescription medications had failed to diminish his debilitating back pain...    John eliminated the pain permanently by immersing himself in low-frequency sound for just 20 minutes while inside the Great Pyramid of Giza.    During this free spiritual sound healing class...    John’s thorough explanation of the biological mechanisms that underpin sound’s ability to support healing and overcome disease will expand your understanding and belief in the efficacy of sound therapy and music medicine.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Music as Medicine&quot;      Participate in an interactive sound-therapy exercise that promises to help you reduce pain, alleviate chronic inflammation, and lower your blood pressure    Learn how to significantly increase the oxygen availability in your bloodstream to optimize your body’s ability to heal    Discover how activating your vagus nerve can help reduce chronic inflammation and slow the rate at which you age    Experience a deep level of calm as music increases your production of dopamine, while decreasing cortisol levels    Stimulate the production and number of white blood cells to strengthen your immune system    When your body is free of pain and able to move fluidly, without stiffness, your mind will nestle into a deeper level of peace and serenity.    Western medicine has embraced “music as medicine” as a clinical specialty after establishing that the body’s healing mechanisms are optimally supported by certain frequencies.    During this inspiring hour, you’ll be guided to stimulate your vagus nerve...    While sonically bathed in “The Dream of the Blue Whale,” a beautiful and etheric song containing frequencies as low as 12 Hz...    Which is ideal for supporting healing and reducing chronic inflammation as your body melts into deep relaxation.    You’ll also learn how to use music as medicine and how musical instruments and the sounds from:      Gongs    Tibetan bowls    And crystal bowls    Can be used to promote full-body healing.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  About Your Sound Healing Facilitator - John Stuart Reid  Acoustics pioneer John Stuart Reid is on a mission to educate and inspire the world about the field of cymatics — the science of visible vibrations and sound. He asserts that sound is the foundation of almost all matter in the Universe and was a potent force in the creation of life in the primordial oceans, thereby carrying the power to heal life.    In his lectures, John reveals groundbreaking information on the mechanisms that support Sound Therapy and Music Medicine, and how they can be applied to improve health naturally.    His CymaScope invention has forever changed the world’s perception of sound by giving us the ability to “see” sound and better understand this ubiquitous aspect of life. His cymatics research, which is elevating this important new field in scientific and medical arenas, includes a study on differentiating between the sounds emitted by healthy cells and cancer cells, published in Water Journal.    In John’s words, “The old adage ‘seeing is believing’ takes on an important new meaning — to see sound is to open a new window on our world, one that has been veiled for all time, until now.”    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you\'ll be able to get a copy of the recording afterwards.

Some are a gentle ripple, barely audible.    You don’t attach a feeling or judgment to any one of them as they ebb and flow, do you?    You don’t react or have an emotional response to each individual wave that comes toward you. You’re just mesmerized by the peacefulness, the constant rhythm — like unconscious breathing — as they come close and recede.    What if you could experience your life in the same way?    What if every situation, every event, no matter how sweet or tumultuous, were just another wave for you to witness, or even ride, calmly and without judgment?    As hard as it is to believe while this unexpected, massive global crisis is still on the rise, you CAN maintain your inner peace under any circumstances — with the help of an established daily spiritual practice.    Join us for a powerful hour with Krishna Das, global icon and bestselling Western chant artist, as he introduces you to the sacred process and profound effects of chanting.  What Devotional Chanting Is  Devotional chanting, which is practiced in a wide range of wisdom traditions, has been used for centuries as a way to train people to stay present in the here and now.    Chanting helps you stay focused... using the mantra as the object of awareness.    It allows you to exercise your letting-go muscle — and develop the fortitude to release negative thoughts and emotions and the stories you believe about yourself... or anything else that takes you away as each moment comes and goes.    What you think of yourself, your life, your work, your community, and our world can change — not by altering external circumstances you can’t control, but by transforming your thought patterns. As a result, difficult situations become less painful because you\'re not as emotionally invested in them.    Of course, there are many spiritual practices designed to bring us continually into the moment...    So why chanting?  Benefits of Practicing Devotional Chanting  In the East, there’s a general understanding that the spirit of all beings is one and the same. Your true nature resides in the “heart cave,” which is the seat of the soul.    Chanting uncovers that place within you.    And as you discover that place, you’ll begin to experience a swell of peace and contentment arising from within. Each time you come back to the mantra, you create new neural pathways in the brain which allow you to move more deeply into who you really are: Truth, Beauty, Unlimited Joy… and Real Love.    In this profound and inspiring hour with Krishna Das, he’ll engage you in a specific chant — a devotional mantra in which he recites different names of the Divine Presence.    Repeating this mantra with love and devotion can help you open your heart and access your inner strength, which influences your experience of life regardless of what’s going on in the outside world... even if just for a few minutes.  Class Topics for &quot;Enter Into the Heart Through Chanting Practice&quot;  In this 60-minute free online event, you’ll discover:      How to release your thoughts — and let go of the stories you believe about yourself and your life    A chant in which you recite names of the Divine... to start to uncover love and peace in your heart and develop your inner warrior    Respite from your overactive mind and anxiety around the global pandemic — a much-needed reset    The many ways you’ll begin to sit differently in your heart as you practice chanting — and how that may manifest in your life    A taste of how, when you chant as daily spiritual practice, you start to calm your mind, relax your body, and come into rhythm and alignment with a higher frequency    The capacity Krishna Das has to guide you into an altered state... with just the power of his voice and presence    We’re so fortunate to have such a dynamic and powerful spiritual teacher and world-renowned performer to help us through this painful moment in history.    And during this free online spiritual healing class, you’ll discover how you can deepen your work with Krishna Das — to embrace the God within you and become more at ease, resilient, grounded, and compassionate during the weeks, months, and years ahead.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Spiritual Teacher - Krishna Das  Layering traditional kirtan with instantly accessible melodies and modern instrumentation, Krishna Das has been called yoga’s “rock star.” With a remarkably soulful voice that touches the deepest chord in even the most casual listener, Krishna Das — known to friends, family, and fans as simply KD — has taken call-and-response chanting out of yoga centers and into concert halls, becoming a worldwide icon and the bestselling Western chant artist of all time. His album Live Ananda (released January 2012) was nominated for a Grammy in the Best New Age album category.    KD spent the late ’60s traveling across the country as a student of Ram Dass. In August 1970, he finally made the journey to India, which led him to Ram Dass’ own beloved guru, Neem Karoli Baba, known to devotees as Maharaj-ji.    Given the name Krishna Das, KD began to chant as part of following the path of Bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion.    He took solace in music, finding peace and strength in both his Bhakti yoga practice as well as in such heroes as Ray Charles, Van Morrison, Steely Dan, and Bruce Springsteen (whom he laughingly calls “the Bodhisattva of New Jersey”). KD also co-founded Triloka Records, a California-based label specializing in world music, releasing such artists as Jai Uttal, sarod virtuoso Ali Akbar Khan, and legendary jazz musician/composer Jackie McLean.    In 1994, KD started to lead chanting at Jivamukti Yoga Center, NYC, with an ever-growing audience of yoga students that has led him to chant with people all around the world. In February 2013, Krishna Das performed at the Grammy awards in Los Angeles, which was streamed online to millions of viewers. The award-winning film One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das, which has been shown in over 100 U.S. cities and in more than 10 countries, is available on DVD everywhere.    KD’s 16th album, Peace Of My Heart, released in October 2018 on behalf of the Kirtan Wallah Foundation, offers nearly two hours of deeply moving, meditative, and artfully restrained new recordings born out of a request from a yoga teacher who works with children on the autism spectrum. Forgoing the ecstatic tempo changes so common to temple-style kirtan, these five new tracks move slowly and deliberately. The song-to-song steadiness is both striking and soothing, and as emotionally impactful as ever.  “The chanting just hits you and you want to be a part of it. That’s the point of this whole thing. That’s what cuts through all the ‘stuff.’ You get lit up. You don’t have to know what it means.” - Krishna Das  ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

Metaphysics for Healing, Self-Knowledge, and Manifesting  Metaphysics is the non-denominational study of “ultimate cause” in the Universe. One of the most basic ideas supporting metaphysics is that everything — including your thoughts and emotions — is created from vibrational energy itself.    Meditation, prayer, and visualization practices are great ways to tune in to the vibrational energies of the psychic realms, increasing your ability to perceive the unseen.    As you hone your skills to read and interpret these energetic pulses on your radar screen, you’ll expand your awareness and consciousness…    … developing an increased capacity to recognize and understand the psychic missives and intuitive aha! moments coming your way.    One of the most intriguing gifts of the 2023 Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities Summit is the invitation to more profoundly embrace your sacred, inner self…    … so you can receive and interpret the many loving blessings being gifted to you by the Universe throughout your day — and during your dreamtime too.    New avenues of scientific exploration are supporting what religious and spiritual traditions have hinted at for millennia — that it’s possible to receive clear guidance from the psychic realms.    By training yourself to enter an altered state of consciousness, you can receive subtle communications from weather, animals, sensations in the body, synchronistic occurrences, and other oracles.    Your awareness of subtle realms and beings —including totems, gods, goddesses, muses, spirits, elementals, angels, saints, avatars, and earth energies — is a powerful tool for healing…    … as you enlist the help of these spirit guides to support you, your family, your community, and the larger world.    A growing community of spiritual teachers and intuitive guides are exploring these ever-expanding frontiers, and we’ve gathered a number of the most prominent experts to share their revelatory experiences and insightful methods of navigating beyond the world we know through our physical senses.    The Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities 2023 Summit gives you access to methods for connecting safely and meaningfully with the unseen psychic realms. Prepare to emerge transformed — without fear of the unknown holding you back from accessing all that your intuition can guide you to receive.      Click here to register.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research. You’ll also be able to safely explore embodiment techniques and integration practices, and engage in revered ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices for deep healing and expanding your consciousness.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is your source for trusted information on this rapidly changing approach to mental wellness and spiritual connectedness.    Together we’ll weave a safe and knowledgeable foundation to empower you to tap into your innate healing intelligence… expand your consciousness… and connect with your true self alongside a community of like-minded seekers.  Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.    Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.    This transformative event invites you to expand your consciousness, discover ways to deepen your inner healing, and connect authentically with others on the collective healing path.  Explore a Conscious Journey through the Psychedelic Renaissance in this Immersive Virtual Retreat-Style Experience  Each day of the Psychedelic Healing Summit has been thoughtfully programmed to offer you a deeper understanding of the emerging world of sacred plant medicines and psychedelic-informed healing.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.

Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.

Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "You’ve probably heard that stress is responsible for over 70% of doctor’s visits. It is one of the biggest drains on your energy levels, and probably the biggest contributor to mood problems like depression and anxiety.    Stress and anxiety are rampant in today’s world (for many reasons you’re no doubt well aware of).    But here’s what you probably don’t know...    What most people do when they’re stressed and they feel their mind racing is to work on THEIR MIND.    But what if the solution isn’t to work on your mind?    It turns out that actually the fastest and most powerful way to get your brain and body out of stress and anxiety isn’t to work on your MIND, but to use your BREATH.    There are two key layers to this:      Short-term techniques to rapidly get your brain and body out of stress/anxiety mode.    Rewiring your nervous system’s baseline levels of stress and anxiety by training your body to breathe optimally. (Over 80% of people AREN’T breathing optimally).    To learn more about this, Ari Whitten has created a live virtual event, &quot;Breathing for Energy,&quot; that can help you revolutionize your relationship with stress and rewire your nervous system from “anxious and fatigued” into “relaxed and energized.”    He’s also partnered with world-renowned breathing expert, Patrick McKeown to develop a brand-new system of breathing practices to rewire your nervous system out of anxiety mode and go from fatigued to energized in just weeks.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During This Free Virtual Breathwork Class      Breathing practices to rewire your nervous system out of stress mode and dramatically decrease anxiety levels    Why deep breathing is actually bad advice (and what the right approach is to increase your energy and decrease anxiety)    How to improve your health, energy, and mood by increasing oxygen delivery to your cells    The 4 keys to optimal breathing (and how to rewire your brain into doing it automatically)    Why dysfunctional breathing is a common cause of brain fog and anxiety (and why fixing your breathing is the hidden key to fixing your anxiety)    Specific breathing practices to calm your nervous system and open your airways to help you sleep deeper than you have since you were a kid    A specific 10-minute morning routine that resets your anxiety and dramatically increases energy levels    This is NOT the typical “take deep abdominal breaths and relax” type of stuff.    This is next-generation breathing science to rewire your brain and body for relaxation and energy.  How Breathing Increases Energy &amp; Immune Health  What about increasing your energy and immune health?    According to Ari, this new system is “the single fastest method to increase energy levels that I’ve found in 25 years of studying health science.”    It focuses on optimizing your cellular energy production through dramatically increasing your body’s oxygen carrying capacity, and the ability of your red blood cells to deliver oxygen to your cells.    He\'ll also be teaching us specific breathing practices to:      Measure your body’s vitality/energy with a simple 1-minute test    Improve your fitness level and endurance dramatically    How to improve your health by increasing oxygen delivery to your cells problems (and how improving circulation to your brain with breathing can fix it)    A powerful 10-minute morning routine that dramatically increases energy levels    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Facilitator - Ari Whitten  Ari Whitten was voted the #1 health influencer of 2020 by the Mindshare natural health community.

 "description": "Dance to open yourself to Source energy, align with your authenticity, and transform your emotional, mental, and physical pain and sorrows into freedom...    Reconnecting with your body’s divinity, wisdom, and capacity for creating personal and collective change.    Explore the Sufi path of living love through a guided dance practice that harnesses the power of presence and your body’s own ability to track and free blocks... and unleash joy.      Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Sacred Dance for Personal &amp; Collective Freedom&quot;  What does freedom feel like to you?    Do you feel joyful, at ease, energized, and confident in your body... and know how to work with your body, mind, and spirit as they are right now to live your best life?    Does the light of your soul fuel your health, thoughts, and expression with grounded, passionate presence... and do you know how to rebalance yourself through the wisdom of your body during times of mental or emotional overwhelm?    While we all yearn to feel free, most of us have been unnaturally conditioned to expect and live within some form of limitation — whether it concerns our bodies, health, careers, relationships, dreams, or the inherent right to self-direct our lives...    As a result, we’ve been cut off not only from the Source of life, but also what matters most to us, our optimal health, and our true selves and purpose — attuning instead to a restrictive version of who we are meant to be.    This oppression and repression is the root cause of much of our emotional, mental, and physical pain and illness, says Banafsheh Sayyad, an acclaimed embodiment teacher and sacred dancer.    She teaches that dance can realign us with our true unlimitedness, and what’s possible for our health, wellbeing, spiritual development, and lives... emboldening our authenticity and sovereignty as the true revolutionary acts that they are.    In joining this free online event with Banafsheh, you’ll explore sacred dance as a path to freedom and a potent technology for unlocking your body’s innate ability to transform emotional, mental, and physical burdens and blocks into vibrant health, expansiveness, and aliveness.    Banafsheh teaches that any infringement upon our freedom can be traced to the health of our bodies. Muscular and joint pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and system constrictions of any kind are just some of the ailments that can arise when we are stifled or silenced — whether self-inflicted or forced upon us by larger power paradigms.    A lack of self-sovereignty also disconnects us from our innate connection to the Divine, or as Banafsheh teaches, the Beloved... as well as to our greater selves and purpose.  Class Topics for &quot;Sacred Dance for Personal &amp; Collective Freedom&quot;  She’ll share how dance can reconnect us and teach us how to hold the joys and sorrows of life in a strong, compassionate, and wide-open heart, empowering the love and goodness that connects us all as we ground ourselves in the joy of being alive.    During the event, you’ll experience this ecstatic connection for yourself during a guided dance practice that harnesses the power of presence and your body’s ability to track and free blocks... and unleash the joy that is buried beneath the stress, tension, and trauma of modern living.    In this empowering online event, you’ll:      Experience dance as a fierce yet tender expression of freedom and activism — and a powerful ally to personal and social change    Learn how Sama, the sacred whirling dance, can alchemize inner and outer chaos as you shift into the stillness, purity, and higher truth of your innate energetic state — the same state of your whirling atoms    Be guided in a dance practice that harnesses the power of presence and your body’s own ability to track and free blocks — and unleash joy    Explore sacred dance as a revolutionary act of embodiment, sovereignty, and love    Discover why patriarchal systems and totalitarian regimes are so threatened by the power of dance — and how one women-led movement is countering this oppression through fearless self-expression    You’ll discover how entering the same whirling state as your atoms and the Universe through Sama, the sacred whirling dance, can help you alchemize inner and outer chaos as you dissolve into the stillness and truth of higher consciousness.    Banafsheh will also share how our individual blocks tend to reflect larger power-driven imbalances in our world... as is the case in Iran, her motherland, where the basic human rights of millions hinge on the brutality and insidiousness of a heartless and power-hungry regime.    There, in the thicket of oppression where women endure the unimaginable for any form of self-expression, the world’s first women-led revolution fueled by the slogan — Woman, Life, Freedom — was born and has inspired the world with the reminder of what we can do when we stand together for freedom...    ... unafraid to speak and dance truth, honoring the divinity of our bodies, and standing for a just and equitable world — all while remaining aligned to what we love.    Banafsheh’s healing modality, Dance of Oneness®, combines freestyle and guided dance such as Flamenco, Persian dance, and whirling, with the teachings of the Tao, the Sufi path of living love, the Divine Feminine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine and chakra work to initiate us into the wisdom, beauty, mysticism, and spirituality of our bodies.      Click here to register for free.      About Your Teacher - Banafsheh Sayyad  Banafsheh Sayyad is a Persian master sacred dancer, choreographer, acupuncturist, transformational teacher, activist, and the founder of Dance of Oneness®. A deeply profound and highly accessible spiritual teacher of embodiment, Banafsheh performs and teaches internationally, initiating people into the wisdom of their bodies. Her signature style of holy wildness infused with ancient wisdom activates transformation and illumination in all those who watch and dance with her from around the globe.    Banafsheh invites the dancer within to remember, reclaim, and resource the innate healing intelligence spiraling in us and all around us. Her easeful instruction and welcoming spirit empower students to feel a true sense of belonging in their bodies. Students experience more passion in their lives by integrating wisdom teachings from throughout the ages.    She is among the few virtuosos of authentic Persian dance in the world, and a pioneer in creating a liberated feminine expression in the Sufi dance genre, previously performed only by men. Her modality, Dance of Oneness®, is a spiritual path and a science of embodiment. It is a fusion of three dimensions, including healing, wisdom teachings, and the rigorous technique and self-expression of the art of dance.    Banafsheh has a master’s degree in dance and choreography from UCLA and a master’s degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Her award-winning work has been presented throughout North America, Europe, and Australia. Her dance film, In the Fire of Grace, with Andrew Harvey, traces Rumi’s journey of the soul in dance.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Metaphysics for Healing, Self-Knowledge, and Manifesting  Metaphysics is the non-denominational study of “ultimate cause” in the Universe. One of the most basic ideas supporting metaphysics is that everything — including your thoughts and emotions — is created from vibrational energy itself.    Meditation, prayer, and visualization practices are great ways to tune in to the vibrational energies of the psychic realms, increasing your ability to perceive the unseen.    As you hone your skills to read and interpret these energetic pulses on your radar screen, you’ll expand your awareness and consciousness…    … developing an increased capacity to recognize and understand the psychic missives and intuitive aha! moments coming your way.    One of the most intriguing gifts of the 2023 Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities Summit is the invitation to more profoundly embrace your sacred, inner self…    … so you can receive and interpret the many loving blessings being gifted to you by the Universe throughout your day — and during your dreamtime too.    New avenues of scientific exploration are supporting what religious and spiritual traditions have hinted at for millennia — that it’s possible to receive clear guidance from the psychic realms.    By training yourself to enter an altered state of consciousness, you can receive subtle communications from weather, animals, sensations in the body, synchronistic occurrences, and other oracles.    Your awareness of subtle realms and beings —including totems, gods, goddesses, muses, spirits, elementals, angels, saints, avatars, and earth energies — is a powerful tool for healing…    … as you enlist the help of these spirit guides to support you, your family, your community, and the larger world.    A growing community of spiritual teachers and intuitive guides are exploring these ever-expanding frontiers, and we’ve gathered a number of the most prominent experts to share their revelatory experiences and insightful methods of navigating beyond the world we know through our physical senses.    The Psychic &amp; Intuitive Abilities 2023 Summit gives you access to methods for connecting safely and meaningfully with the unseen psychic realms. Prepare to emerge transformed — without fear of the unknown holding you back from accessing all that your intuition can guide you to receive.      Click here to register.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.

Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.

Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?

 "description": "Explore life-enhancing practices that help you connect to the true depth of your innate clairvoyance...  Including a guided practice featuring the Crystal Facet, a space within your energy field that unifies your full self, enabling you to more easily manifest your most fulfilling future.        Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During Unlock Your Clairvoyant Powers  What if you were more clairvoyant than you think?    And what if you could turn on this multifaceted psychic capability for perceiving future events whenever you need it?    In fact, everyone has this power of “clear-seeing” — yet the vast majority of us don’t experience this gift at its full capacity (or sometimes at all) because we don’t realize there are many distinct clairvoyant styles, says respected intuitive energy healer Cyndi Dale.    If one style of clairvoyance doesn’t resonate with you, says Cyndi, you’re free to experiment with another, giving you another doorway into potential futures...    You might find that your ideal style of clairvoyance is obtaining visual messages from nature, or through dreams you have during the day or night. Maybe your visions of the future are most powerful when you receive them from guides, or when you base them on a feeling or bodily sensation.    As you access more of your natural clairvoyant abilities, you can perform healings for yourself and others, analyze the past, receive spiritual guidance, connect with your deeper soul, manifest your authentic desires, listen to your body and feelings, get a glimpse into possible futures — and sometimes even design possible futures...    Most significantly, you have the power to open up, set a course, and live your best life, starting now.    If you’re curious to discover life-enhancing tools and practices that can help you access or uplevel the profound gift of clairvoyance you’ve always had...    Join us for a brand-new 1-hour event as Cyndi introduces you to the Crystal Facet, a space in your personal energy field that unifies all the elements of who you are — think of it as an internal control room where you can use your power of clairvoyance to manifest a future vision.    Whether you’ve already accessed some of your clairvoyance, or have yet to discover your abilities, you’ll gain an understanding about how to activate different forms of clairvoyance. As Cyndi will explain, each style of clairvoyance relates to a different chakra.  Class Topics for &quot;Unlock Your Clairvoyant Powers&quot;  During the event, Cyndi will walk you through a visualization practice to use your clairvoyance to construct an image of a desired future. You’ll then learn how to enhance this image so it can be released through your biofield and your many planes and energy bodies, so your vision can become reality.    In this hour-long free online event, you’ll discover:      The powerful truth that everyone, including you, is clairvoyant (able to perceive future events), often without realizing it — and how you can access and interpret your visions to boost your clairvoyant powers    How to heal yourself and manifest your desires by customizing the 12 styles of clairvoyance — each with a different function and link to a specific chakra — to fit your personality and higher self    How to use your clairvoyance to interact with the Crystal Facet in your biofield to manifest a desire    Cyndi’s tools and skills that can help you realize the true depth of your clairvoyance, including the Spirit-to-Spirit technique, accessing the God Spot, and infusing absolute scalar waves into your manifestation practice    A step-by-step guided process for creating a vision to activate all forms of your clairvoyance and intuition — whether you already know you’re clairvoyant, or have yet to discover your clairvoyant powers    You’ll explore how using what Cyndi calls an intuitive toolkit to activate the forms of clairvoyance most available to you can result in more effective reception, interpretation, and sharing.    Cyndi, a natural intuitive since childhood, is a globally recognized authority in the field of subtle energy and energy work. After working with over 70,000 students and clients, she’s developed a keen ability to perceive what’s blocking others from opening to their essential energy and applying their healing gifts.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Are you ready to take a deep dive into your inner work?    How can you make a quantum leap in your own consciousness... and also be part of a collective shift — that’s truly necessary for the survival of our civilization, and the flowering of humanity’s highest potential?    Yes, the call is that big.    One potent approach to intensifying your own self-understanding while also holding a vision — BEING a vision — for unprecedented personal, cultural, and global change... is the profound study and experience of the Enneagram teachings and practices.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Living An Enneagram-Informed Life&quot;  Whether you’ve recently developed a strong curiosity about the Enneagram…    Or you already have a basic understanding of the Enneagram types and their qualities…    For your own inner work or for your work with others in your healing profession, the Enneagram can help you deeply understand the fundamentals in order to confidently embark on a journey of deeper and deeper inner work.    As you gently shift and up-level your consciousness, you contribute to a life-and-world-changing movement toward a new and just reality — for all.    During this free online spiritual growth workshop, Russ Hudson and Jessica Dibb will introduce you to the most important elements of living an Enneagram-informed life. They’ll be sharing with you what you can expect and how truly understanding the Enneagram can radically transform you and those around you, in ways that may astound you!    For example, you\'ll:      Be guided through an opening presence practice    Discover what it means to live an Enneagram-informed life    Be presented with the true wisdom, purpose, and depth of the Enneagram    Explore the three centers and the path to awakening    Hear the call for a commitment to change and evolve through the extensive excavation work of the Enneagram    You’ll emerge with the capacity to become present, grounded and centered. To become the compassionate witness of your personality, behaviors and responses. You’ll cultivate the courage, confidence, and curiosity to look and work deeply within yourself as a lifelong way of being.    When you walk away from this inspirational hour with Russ and Jessica, you’ll likely have a whole new willingness to look more deeply and then deeper still into the depths of your being — the depths of your soul — both through intensive wisdom teachings… and by staying present, moment by moment, as you experience practices and processes designed to help you find your authentic self, again and again.  Why Is the Enneagram Such a Potent Path for Growth?  The Enneagram’s ancient wisdom gives us a map for human purpose and possibility... and lays out a modern-day, personalized path to wholeness for each of us.    This tool for transformation illuminates our gifts and provides a framework for our personal and spiritual evolution. It also reveals how we’re often held back by the shadow side of our personality — our own deeply rooted, unconscious patterns that are hard for us to see.    The Enneagram helps us dig deeply into understanding our own type, and the emotional patterns that have structured (and often restricted) our lives for so long.    It’s universally applicable to any endeavor... to whatever profession or work you choose to do in the world.    And, to truly benefit from the Enneagram in the deepest possible way, it’s important to move way beyond the characteristics of your type... and understand that it’s about interrelationship and development... and the connection between our ego (or personality) and what we are as true presence, as essence.  Why Living an Enneagram-Informed Life Is So Important Right Now  George Gurdjieff, who was the first to bring the original Enneagram teachings into the modern world, said that the work of the Enneagram will come into prominence at the time when it’s most needed.    This. Is. That. Time.    It’s apparent that the world is in need of a collective leap in consciousness. And it’s clear that many of the “solutions” we’re using to solve personal, national, and global problems aren’t working.    To create significant and sustainable change — to help us get through our collective traumas — we have to move into the cave of our own wounds and do the necessary repair work.    And that’s exactly why we need the Enneagram right now — to awaken into higher consciousness by living an Enneagram-informed life.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  About Your Enneagram Teachers - Russ Hudson and Jessica Dibb  About Russ Hudson  Russ Hudson has established himself over the last three decades as one of the top teachers and developers of the Enneagram personality typology in the world today. Actively involved in the Enneagram community, Russ is the co-founder of the Enneagram Institute and President Emeritus as well as a Founding Director and former Vice-President of the International Enneagram Association, a global organization advancing knowledge of the subject. He has been writing and teaching full time with The Enneagram Institute as well as on his own since 1991.    He\'s co-authored with Don Richard Riso five bestselling books on the subject, including The Wisdom of the Enneagram and Personality Types. These books are widely considered to be not only groundbreaking contributions in the field of Enneagram studies, but also important contributions to the literature of psychological type. The pair developed a scientifically validated test instrument, the Riso-Hudson Type Indicator (RHETI), now considered a standard test in the Enneagram field. The RHETI has been used by numerous Fortune 500 companies.    Russ has a solid background in science as well as in studies of philosophy and religion and has approached his work with the Enneagram holding both perspectives. He originally encountered the Enneagram through the Gurdjieff Work and sees it as a map for personal development and awareness more than as merely a system for categorizing people. He has emphasized the importance of cultivating presence and mindfulness as a foundation for authentic work with the Enneagram, and has worked to align the study of the Enneagram and spiritual practice and bring their mutual benefit into greater public awareness.    He has appeared on Good Morning America, and The CBS Morning Show, as well as on several dozen radio and television shows as an expert on personality type. He has become a popular speaker at conferences and retreat centers around the world, including the Esalen Institute, the Wisdom 2.0 Conference, and the Science and Non-Duality Conference (SAND).  Testimonials for Russ Hudson  &quot;Russ Hudson is the best Enneagram teacher I know. His knowledge, presence, warm humor, and genuine caring is uplifting and healing at the same time. One learns so much new about the Enneagram in every module, and at the same time you also have this amazing feeling about getting this deeper understanding about yourself and others. Thank you, Russ!  — Sari Heiskanen    &quot;Working with the Enneagram has been life-altering, and Russ Hudson’s courses have opened up new avenues of thinking for me. My spiritual life is shifting away from “dogma” into a clearer understanding of how marvelous and amazing creation is — and how our diverse views are all part of that. I look forward to continuing to work with the insights that these Enneagram teachings have brought me.&quot; — Harriette Heibel    &quot;Russ’ course coincided with the tragic breakup of my relationship due to my own lifelong defensive patterns of behaviors. Following this course has helped me beyond imagination, to truly embrace the inherent traits of my type (4) as biased by the instinctual drives. I would go so far as to say this course was life-changing, and I cannot thank Russ enough.&quot; — Mark Drax    &quot;Russ is a master, in the Enneagram and in heartfelt understanding, respect, and kindness to fellow beings... In his presence, something pure inside gets awakened.&quot; — Sajili    &quot;Russ is an extremely gifted teacher. With patience, humor, and wisdom, he is able to guide us to places that are normally too defended to see or admit. This course definitely had that effect on me... I’m grateful to you, Russ, and to The Shift Network, who have made it their mission to create opportunities such as these for as many as possible.&quot; — Scott  About Jessica Dibb  Jessica Dibb is founder, spiritual director, and principal teacher of the Inspiration Consciousness School and Community, dedicated to promoting personal, relational, and planetary wellness.

She’s a superb guide and support for people’s inner processes, as well as a brilliant designer of experiential exercises and practices. Jessica does not do anything half-heartedly, and I’m certain she’ll take you on an extraordinary journey of soul restoration, real emotional breakthroughs, and profound self-discovery.&quot; — Russ Hudson    &quot;I have a more loving relationship with my essential self. I have the desire to embrace life in a more open and willing way. I can say with full honesty that I have woken up in a way I did not expect to have happened in an online class. I will hold appreciation for these teachings and our beloved teacher for a long time going forward. She assisted me in loving myself and LIFE more fully. That is amazing for not even being able to be live in the class, but it was through experiencing her presence in the teachings and her LOVE that came through so strong.&quot; — Eva    &quot;This has been the biggest help in understanding the journey of my life, the dark places, the personality, and the soul essence... Jessica was so at ease as she led us to experience each ego point, and I feel my own wholeness in embodying these energy patterns — but I also feel like I also understand many friends and family so much better. Incredible tool and fantastic teacher!&quot; — Jackie  =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend the scheduled session... 🌟    Register now because you\'ll be able to get a copy of the recording afterwards.

Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.

Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.

Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.

Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.    Yes, we are mortal creatures, but until it is time to get our wings, we can live vibrant and active lives.    You already have heard of older people who accomplish extraordinary things, whether,      running marathons    inventing breakthroughs    writing books    taking on massive new projects    starting an exciting new career    finding new love…    That is possible for nearly everyone and is validated by modern science and neuroscience.    You will learn simple &amp; subtle movements that will wake up and rewire your brain.    During this free health class you will gently transform physical, cognitive, and emotional patterns of movement, thinking, beliefs, and emotions that cause most of the issues involving mobility, flexibility, strength, and pain.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Benefits of Using NeuroMovement  These simple movements will activate your brain for improved brain functioning, which will lead to      A renewed enthusiasm for learning    Improve cognitive abilities    Peak performance    Pain-free mobillty    More energy    Sharper thinking    Enhanced awareness    Joy and enthusiasm    Will you have to do these NeuroMovements every day for the rest of your life? No!    Do them now, see immediate results, and do them again when you want to up your vitality anytime in the future.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  How Anat Baniel Discovered NeuroMovement  Decades ago, a woman named Anat Baniel began studying the relationship between movement and the brain.    She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "The teachings in this free live webinar were initially inspired by some very traumatic events several years ago that happened to a man by the name of Derek Rydall...    The country was in recession. Derek was broke and jobless. Bill collectors were calling. And he was about to be evicted from his small North Hollywood apartment…    One night, literally living on a prayer, he sat in his faux leather meditation chair and laid down the gauntlet to whatever God may be in heaven and said…  “Either this spiritual stuff is b.s. or I’m not getting it! But one way or another I’m gonna find out, ‘cause I’m not leaving until I do -- even if they have to pry my cold, penniless hands from this fake leather chair!”  Daylight turned to dusk. The crickets came out for their nightly chorus.    Derek wrestled with his inner demons, and he was getting pinned to the mat over and over again…    But at some point before dawn, a Voice inside him began to speak, and it revealed the keys to an inner wealth that shattered everything the world had taught him.    Two days later, he got a job earning a year’s worth of income for only two days’ work. Fortunately, that was just the beginning.    The download on that fateful night turned Derek’s whole life around.    It took him from living on mac n’ cheese in a one-room apartment, to regular income, launching his life’s work, finding true love, and becoming financially secure over the next couple years.    During his free upcoming spiritual webinar, &quot;The Hidden Keys to Manifest Wealth - No Matter What You Face&quot; he\'s going to share what that voice said.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;The Hidden Keys to Manifest Wealth&quot;  Wealth Creation Isn’t magical, mysterious, or personal... it\'s principle.

 "description": "Right now, we’re being bombarded by more false beliefs than ever…    And because of the crisis, we’re more vulnerable than ever to accepting them.    Yes, we must take care of our physical health and our loved ones.    And, if we want to thrive during these times and beyond…    We MUST also take care of our mental and emotional health as well.  Myths &amp; Misleading Messages About Money &amp; Success  First, let\'s take a look at some common (yet misleading and unhelpful) statements we may have heard about money and success:      “It’s not spiritual or good to think about money or success during a crisis”    If I keep growing my business now, I’ll hurt people and be a bad person”    “To succeed you must sacrifice (time, freedom, love, integrity, health)”    “Becoming wealthy &amp; successful is hard, especially during downtimes”    What do these all have in common?    They’re Wealth Shadows &amp; Values Conflicts – and they’re unconsciously driving the results we get in our personal and professional lives.    More importantly, in down times, they’ll take you down much, much faster.    We’re living in scary and uncertain times. It’s really hard to deal with.    It’s not your fault, and you don’t need to suffer, struggle, and go down with the ship.    In fact, it’s during times like this that some of the greatest leaders, healers, success-stories, and fortunes are made.    Why shouldn’t that be you?    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why You Should Attend &quot;Wealth Shadows &amp; How They Sabotage Your Success&quot;            ‘Thought Viruses’ of fear and limitation are coming from deep human beliefs about what’s right and wrong and who we should or shouldn’t be... otherwise known as SHADOWS.    And they will destroy more lives than any disease if we don’t inoculate ourselves from them.    The challenge is that these limited beliefs about wealth and success have become integrated into our stories and systems, into our very map of reality and identity…    …and they are sabotaging you now, or will in the future, unless you identify them and learn how to transform them.            Just as when we are under stress, our body’s immune system is less able to handle the onslaught of germs, and we are more likely to get sick, likewise…    …when we are under stress, our psychological and emotional immune system is less capable of fending off the limited beliefs of the world (and of our own unconscious).    The result can often be a falling back into old, default beliefs, self-sabotaging patterns, and a downward spiral as our core shadows come to the surface to feed on our fear.    But there is a way to make yourself immune from these. Even better, to turn their poison into a powerful medicine that can heal your life and cause a quantum leap in growth and success!    In times like this, the greatest leaders, success-stories, and fortunes are made!    Why shouldn’t that be you?    If you want to lay the foundations to thrive, now and in the future, join this live one-time only training.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================                    What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Wealth Shadows &amp; How They Sabotage Your Success&quot;      Learn the Secret of Your Unconscious Wealth Shadows -- where they come from, how they\'re blocking you, and how to get free from them.    Discover Your Unconscious Map of Reality, and how it is greatly limiting what you can see, do, and achieve (this is a game-changer).    Understand How Your Unconscious Values are Wreaking Havoc, overwhelming you, burning you out, and sabotaging your success!    Heal, Release and Rewire Critical Unconscious Patterns Once and for All!    This process has helped thousands of people thrive during crises – recessions, job loss, divorce, physical, emotional, and financial breakdown…    They’ve gone from bankruptcy to more business than they could handle, earning more in a month than they have in a year, getting new jobs, new deals, new mates…    Don’t let these unconscious patterns sabotage you another day.    ⚠️ There is no replay planned. ⚠️    So register now and make sure you can attend at the scheduled time.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Derek Rydall  After a life-changing brush with death, Derek Rydall tried to become a monk, then minister, before becoming a licensed integrative therapist.

So when\'s the last time you did, said or thought something - And immediately felt a regretful sense of disconnect from it?Like that wasn\'t really you...But rather some sort of inner ’[glitch]’ that caused you to act in misalignment with your Higher Self?        When it comes to our finances and careers, we do this all the time.We overspend. We procrastinate. We overthink. We second-guess ourselves. We base our decisions on a sense of fear rather than a sense of abundance.Even though on a conscious level we know we shouldn’t.Most people would say this is just human nature.But according to my friends Natalie and Mary, self-destructive behavior like this is actually a directresult of deep-set limiting beliefs that were implanted in our subconscious minds since childhood.Think of it like how a virus silently corrupts a computer - often we don\'t even realize it\'s there.A few years back, Natalie had a hunch that this phenomenon is the root cause of most people’s financial and career struggles.And so she began studying neuroscience, personal growth and psychology to create [a process] for exposing these hidden beliefs - And replacing them with empowering beliefs that will serve a person instead of sabotage them.Then Natalie and Mary came together to perfect and share this fascinating process with the world.The result?        Deep epiphanies and instant personal transformations for thousands and thousands of people.That\'s why it\'s important for you to attend their free online workshop - where they’ll be guiding you through this exact process.Ready to become limitless?

 "description": "Explore the shadow sides of the Enneagram types for greater self-awareness, inner peace, and compassion — for yourself and others during challenging times.    The secret teachings of the Enneagram — ancient wisdom from Babylon, Greece, and Egypt — view your personality as a dynamic “map” to your Highest Self and full potential as a human being.    Illuminating nine primary personality types and paths to wholeness, these powerful teachings support you in unearthing your true essence, deepening your intuition, and embodying your unique gifts.    In these times of turmoil — clouded by the missteps of the collective shadow — we can turn to the Enneagram to help us unveil our own personal shadows…    ...those parts of our personality we don’t see or may attempt to hide, which actually hold the keys to our personal and spiritual evolution.    When we welcome the parts of ourselves we habitually deny, we become better able to navigate stressful times, maintain healthy relationships, and achieve the inner peace we so strongly desire.    Enneagram teacher, psychotherapist, and author Beatrice Chestnut will provide a fascinating glimpse into the shadow sides of your Enneagram type, as well as the gifts that await when you learn how to illuminate and allow these parts of yourself to surface and accept yourself more fully.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Illuminating the Shadow of Your Enneagram Type&quot;      Discover the Enneagram as a map to wholeness that can help you better navigate your life    Glimpse the shadow sides of the 9 personality types of the Enneagram and learn how your own shadow may be emerging in these difficult times    Discover how the Enneagram increases self-understanding, illuminates relationship dynamics, and helps build compassion for self and others    Learn how healing practitioners and therapists can use the Enneagram to gain powerful insights into a client’s personality and challenges    Experience a guided meditation to tap into the shadow, and light, of each Enneagram type and discover each personality’s governing focus and common blind spots    Now more than ever, as fear, anger, frustration, and overwhelm are pushing many of us to our limits and exposing our shadows, we can use the Enneagram to better see and understand these blind spots in ourselves and others.    You won’t want to miss this opportunity to harness this powerful tool for building healthier, more stable, and more loving relationships — especially during challenging times.    You’ll explore the shadow sides of the Enneagram types for greater self-awareness, inner peace, and compassion — for yourself and others during these difficult times.    When fear, anger, frustration, and overwhelm are pushing many of us to our limits and exposing our shadows, we can use the Enneagram to better see and understand these blind spots in ourselves and others.  Illuminating Your Shadow for Self-Understanding &amp; Compassion  Enneagram insights can shed light on what may be preventing you from living harmoniously with your loved ones (especially while sheltering in place), accessing self-understanding and compassion, and being who you truly want to be.    And, as you identify your Enneagram type and enter into a deeper exploration of the whole system, you glimpse the characteristics and shadow sides inherent in all the types… so you not only grow compassion for yourself, but for others as well.    The Enneagram can be a window into understanding the triggers and difficult behaviors of others, as well as how you may be projecting your own shadow onto someone else.    It can be a powerful tool for building healthier, more stable, and more loving relationships — especially during challenging times.    If you’re already working with the Enneagram, this self-empowering hour with Enneagram teacher, psychotherapist, and author Beatrice Chestnut will provide a fascinating look into the shadow sides of your Enneagram type, as well as the gifts that await when you learn how to illuminate and allow these parts of yourself to surface and accept yourself more fully.    You just might discover something new about your Enneagram type that you never knew before.    Beatrice is one of the most authoritative voices and thought leaders in the modern Enneagram movement. She’s been studying and working with the Enneagram for 30 years — since she learned about the system from pioneering Enneagram expert David Daniels, MD.    During this free online spiritual growth event, she’ll take you beyond simple personality typing — to discover the essential aspects for lasting transformation through the Enneagram.    More than anything, Beatrice is committed to walking her talk, and has used the Enneagram as a lifelong tool for expanding her own inner work. She views its ancient teachings as an important modern-day framework for our personal and spiritual evolution — and for raising global consciousness to create a more positive, sustainable, and self-aware world.    Enneagram and Self-Awareness  Beatrice Chestnut Shares How the Enneagram Helps You Know Yourself More Fully  There are many sides to our personality that we don’t or can’t see — and we often act from those unconscious places.  The Enneagram helps us understand ourselves better — even our shadow sides that we may not wish to acknowledge.    According to Beatrice Chestnut, looking openly and honestly at all parts of ourselves helps us become more compassionate. In the following short video, Beatrice explains how she’s come to see the Enneagram as a secret weapon for better understanding ourselves and others.  Beatrice Chestnut Shares Why Shadow Work Is So Important  It can be quite the challenge to come to terms with your shadow self — those less-than-ideal parts of yourself that you’re not fully conscious of. It’s understandable to want to keep those aspects of your personality out of sight and out of mind.    Of course, when you ignore your shadow self, it doesn’t go away — it’s still part of who you are. When you don’t understand or recognize these parts of yourself, you often unknowingly project them out into the world and onto other people.    For instance, have you ever met someone who possessed a trait or characteristic that just plain irritated you? Perhaps you couldn’t put your finger on why your aversion was so strong. Well, you may have been unknowingly projecting your unprocessed, less-than-ideal qualities onto that person!    It’s so imperative to acknowledge your shadow side and learn to embrace your whole self. The Enneagram is a map to wholeness that can help you better navigate your life. Each of the nine Enneagram personality types has a shadow side, and exploring them can lead to greater self-awareness, inner peace, and compassion for yourself and others — no matter what’s happening in the world.    Have you ever met someone who possessed a trait or characteristic that irritated or triggered you? Perhaps you couldn’t put your finger on why your aversion was so strong…    As Beatrice teaches, you may have been unconsciously projecting your unprocessed, less-than-ideal qualities onto that person.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Enneagram Teacher - Beatrice Chestnut  One of the most authoritative voices and thought leaders in the modern Enneagram movement, Beatrice Chestnut has been studying and working with the Enneagram for 30 years.

 "description": "Have you ever had an experience of spiritual awakening?    If so, it was probably one of the most meaningful moments of your life.    But if you’re like most of us, chances are your spiritual experiences have also been fairly short-lived, leaving you longing to reconnect with the sacredness you felt in those moments, but not sure how to make that a sustained reality.    As a spiritual seeker, you’ve probably tried meditation practice in the hope that it might bring you closer to the awakening you’ve sensed is possible.    But have you noticed that most meditation practices tend to be repetitive and (dare I say it) even tedious?    The truth is that they rarely give us experiences of the promise of illumination they point to.    If that’s been your experience, too, then you\'ll appreciate the “direct awakening” practices Craig has developed... because they are such a radical departure from the meditation most of us have been taught that it’s really more accurate to think of it as an evolution of meditation.    Or as Craig calls it: &quot;Meditation 2.0&quot;    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Through his extensive research and work with thousands of students, Craig has developed a way of meditating that enables you to tap directly into the miracle of awakened consciousness every time you practice.    Instead of spending decades doing “indirect” practices like repeating mantras, watching your breath or being “mindful” in an effort to prepare for a future moment of Enlightenment, you can literally practice aligning with the limitless energy, intelligence and freedom of Enlightenment right now.  What You\'ll Learn During Craig Hamilton\'s Meditation 2.0 Workshop  During this 90-minute webinar, Craig will share the surprising truth he’s learned in his decades of meditation research--and the unexpected discovery that is revolutionizing the way we think about spiritual practice and awakening.    You’ll learn . . .      The simple shift in attention that can instantly open the door to awakened awareness    The most common obstacles to deep meditation and the one key that enables you to bypass all of them and step directly into the life-changing recognition of your “enlightened nature”    Why a “busy mind” is not an obstacle to profound meditation and how to be truly free no matter what your mind is doing    How to ensure that meditation is never boring or tedious but always a dynamic unfolding journey into the evernew miracle of Enlightenment    Why short periods of meditation can be more enlightening than long, drawn out practice sessions and how to make every moment of meditation a moment of awakening    How to bring your awakening off the meditation cushion and into your daily life through the use of “engaged inquiry” practices throughout your day    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend &quot;Meditation 2.0&quot; With Craig Hamilton  Genuine spiritual awakening has always been the pinnacle of human aspiration.    If you’ve had even a glimpse of this profound spiritual potential, you know that an extraordinary, enlightened life is possible–a life filled with meaning and purpose, in which you have access to a seemingly limitless well of inspiration, wisdom, love and creativity.    Yet for thousands of years, the supreme goal of Enlightenment has been shrouded in mystery, believed to be accessible only indirectly through decades (or even lifetimes) of repetitive and often tedious meditation practice.    Now, in what many are calling the biggest spiritual breakthrough since the discovery of Enlightenment itself, all of that is about to change.    Thanks to the pioneering efforts of spiritual teacher Craig Hamilton and a bold team of consciousness researchers, a radical new approach to spiritual practice is being born, bringing the possibility of authentic spiritual Enlightenment within reach for all of us.    Craig calls it “The Practice of Direct Awakening.” And it is rapidly turning every assumption we’ve had about spiritual practice and Enlightenment on its head.    What if, instead of spending the next 10, 20, or 30 years doing mindfulness practices, watching your breath or repeating mantras in an attempt to prepare for Enlightenment, you could engage in a daily practice that gave you direct access to Enlightened Consciousness right now?    What if, instead of hoping for a lightning bolt of spiritual insight to awaken you sometime in the distant future, you could practice aligning with the limitless energy, intelligence and freedom of Enlightenment every single day?    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Spiritual masters East and West have always told us that the miracle of Enlightened Consciousness already exists, fully formed, inside of each of us–that this luminous awareness is none other than our own true nature.    The radical discovery that is transforming our very understanding of spiritual awakening is that it is possible to tap directly into this infinite energy, intelligence and freedom right now.    All that is required to immediately access this superconscious, unbounded way of being is learning a simple set of daily practices that enable you to step directly into the miracle of awakened consciousness every time you practice.    Once you discover the power of direct awakening, your life may never be the same.    Not surprisingly, the results of this breakthrough are already sending ripples throughout the world of contemporary spiritual practice.    In addition to teaching these techniques to thousands of his own students over the past decade, in recent years Craig Hamilton has been invited to teach this revolutionary practice to some of the most celebrated spiritual leaders alive today.    Craig is holding a live global online gathering to share the essence of this powerful, life-changing practice–and the groundbreaking discovery behind it.    In this 90-minute seminar, Craig will share the surprising truth he’s learned in his decades of meditation research–and the unexpected finding that is revolutionizing the way we think about spiritual practice and awakening.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Meditation Teacher - Craig Hamilton      Craig Hamilton is a spiritual trailblazer whose innovative approach to transformation is bringing enlightenment down to earth and unlocking the codes to our highest human potential.

 "description": "How would your life change if...  Your every thought, belief, habit and emotion could propel you forward instead of hold you back?  Where you could finally rid yourself of self-sabotaging habits like procrastination... And instead replace them with empowering habits that serve your highest good?  During this free online workshop, you\'ll learn how to rise above any sort of challenges and self-sabotage you’re facing that’s showing up in your finances, career, and overall well-being.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;How To End Procrastination And Self-Sabotage Forever&quot;  You\'re going to learn exactly how to equip yourself with today\'s best (and scientifically proven) mind tools for replacing procrastination &amp; self-sabotage with:    Productivity  Worthiness  Success  Fulfillment  Joy  Connection    It’s no secret that we all want those things. Yet why do they sometimes feel so far out of reach? If you often wonder this too then remember this important Universal truth:  You already have everything you need to manifest the best outcomes into your life. It\'s all right between your ears!  Yes, your ears are your biggest asset, yet they also become your biggest block!  This is due to all the programming that enters our subconscious minds at a very early age. Unfortunately, it\'s often our own well-meaning minds that rob us of our fullest potential and our biggest dreams.  Understanding the neuroscience behind self-sabotage can be tricky, and that\'s why Natalie Ledwell and John Assaraf (two living legends in the fields of personal growth and mind science) are hosting this workshop to help you do just that!  They are going to reveal the astonishing neuroscience behind self-sabotage, and why your own brain often actively tries to hold you back from success and opportunities.  (Here’s a hint: it’s not because your brain dislikes you. On the contrary, it’s actually trying to help!)  Most importantly, they’ll also show you how to rewire your brain to release its self-sabotaging patterns - and even replace them with empowering ones that dramatically:    Accelerate your productivity  Increase creativity  Bring peace of mind,  Improve your health    In addition to teaching you about the neuroscience and what you can do...  Natalie and John are going to guide you through a mind exercise, known as an ‘Emotional Freedom Technique’ - which dives into your subconscious mind, and instantly erases one of your self-sabotaging patterns from inside you.  As you’ll discover in the Masterclass, the single best way to transform your inner programming - and in turn, your life - isn’t through struggle or willpower. It’s in understanding how your mind truly works - and retuning yourself for peak performance and extraordinary success.  This is the kind of life-changing information you’d normally pay top dollar for at a closed - door seminar - but it’s all yours for free on this session.  No matter what your current situation is, how you might look or feel, or how far gone you think you might be, what you’ll discover in this Masterclass will set you on the path to the life you WANT. No more suffering. No more settling.  Amplifying Your Best Qualities &amp; Rewiring Your Brain for Happiness  What about those people who can just thrive and prosper by default - even when everything around them is in chaos? A person’s true nature is amplified when faced with challenging circumstances. For example:    If you’re kind, you will become kinder.  If you’re strong, you will become stronger.  If you’re loving, you will show more love.    But it’s important to note that the same is also true for our more disempowering traits.  Lately, many people have expressed that they’re feeling at least a little more anxiety, negativity, and self-doubt due to what’s going on in the world.  This is precisely why there’s no better time than now to start looking inwards, and focus on our own personal growth to help us not only survive but thrive through these challenging times.  Did you know that you can rewire your brain to be happy by simply recalling 3 things you\'re grateful for every day?  Isn’t it fascinating how such a small repetitive act can make such a huge difference?  This process is just one of the brain hacks that you\'ll be learning during &quot;How To End Procrastination And Self-Sabotage Forever - And Rewire Your Brain For Unlimited Success&quot; with Natalie Ledwell and John Assaraf.  When you join these two Personal Development gurus, they’re going to go deeeeeep and share with you some of their very best (and not often shared) tips and techniques for overcoming self-sabotaging thoughts and patterns that are destroying your ability to move forward right now.  But this isn’t just a science class - It’s an opportunity to learn exactly what you need to do to rise above any sort of challenges and to step into your potential!  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.    Yes, we are mortal creatures, but until it is time to get our wings, we can live vibrant and active lives.    You already have heard of older people who accomplish extraordinary things, whether,      running marathons    inventing breakthroughs    writing books    taking on massive new projects    starting an exciting new career    finding new love…    That is possible for nearly everyone and is validated by modern science and neuroscience.    You will learn simple &amp; subtle movements that will wake up and rewire your brain.    During this free health class you will gently transform physical, cognitive, and emotional patterns of movement, thinking, beliefs, and emotions that cause most of the issues involving mobility, flexibility, strength, and pain.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Benefits of Using NeuroMovement  These simple movements will activate your brain for improved brain functioning, which will lead to      A renewed enthusiasm for learning    Improve cognitive abilities    Peak performance    Pain-free mobillty    More energy    Sharper thinking    Enhanced awareness    Joy and enthusiasm    Will you have to do these NeuroMovements every day for the rest of your life? No!    Do them now, see immediate results, and do them again when you want to up your vitality anytime in the future.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  How Anat Baniel Discovered NeuroMovement  Decades ago, a woman named Anat Baniel began studying the relationship between movement and the brain.    She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?

Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Explore life-enhancing practices that help you connect to the true depth of your innate clairvoyance...  Including a guided practice featuring the Crystal Facet, a space within your energy field that unifies your full self, enabling you to more easily manifest your most fulfilling future.        Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During Unlock Your Clairvoyant Powers  What if you were more clairvoyant than you think?    And what if you could turn on this multifaceted psychic capability for perceiving future events whenever you need it?    In fact, everyone has this power of “clear-seeing” — yet the vast majority of us don’t experience this gift at its full capacity (or sometimes at all) because we don’t realize there are many distinct clairvoyant styles, says respected intuitive energy healer Cyndi Dale.    If one style of clairvoyance doesn’t resonate with you, says Cyndi, you’re free to experiment with another, giving you another doorway into potential futures...    You might find that your ideal style of clairvoyance is obtaining visual messages from nature, or through dreams you have during the day or night. Maybe your visions of the future are most powerful when you receive them from guides, or when you base them on a feeling or bodily sensation.    As you access more of your natural clairvoyant abilities, you can perform healings for yourself and others, analyze the past, receive spiritual guidance, connect with your deeper soul, manifest your authentic desires, listen to your body and feelings, get a glimpse into possible futures — and sometimes even design possible futures...    Most significantly, you have the power to open up, set a course, and live your best life, starting now.    If you’re curious to discover life-enhancing tools and practices that can help you access or uplevel the profound gift of clairvoyance you’ve always had...    Join us for a brand-new 1-hour event as Cyndi introduces you to the Crystal Facet, a space in your personal energy field that unifies all the elements of who you are — think of it as an internal control room where you can use your power of clairvoyance to manifest a future vision.    Whether you’ve already accessed some of your clairvoyance, or have yet to discover your abilities, you’ll gain an understanding about how to activate different forms of clairvoyance. As Cyndi will explain, each style of clairvoyance relates to a different chakra.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.    Yes, we are mortal creatures, but until it is time to get our wings, we can live vibrant and active lives.    You already have heard of older people who accomplish extraordinary things, whether,      running marathons    inventing breakthroughs    writing books    taking on massive new projects    starting an exciting new career    finding new love…    That is possible for nearly everyone and is validated by modern science and neuroscience.    You will learn simple &amp; subtle movements that will wake up and rewire your brain.    During this free health class you will gently transform physical, cognitive, and emotional patterns of movement, thinking, beliefs, and emotions that cause most of the issues involving mobility, flexibility, strength, and pain.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Benefits of Using NeuroMovement  These simple movements will activate your brain for improved brain functioning, which will lead to      A renewed enthusiasm for learning    Improve cognitive abilities    Peak performance    Pain-free mobillty    More energy    Sharper thinking    Enhanced awareness    Joy and enthusiasm    Will you have to do these NeuroMovements every day for the rest of your life? No!    Do them now, see immediate results, and do them again when you want to up your vitality anytime in the future.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  How Anat Baniel Discovered NeuroMovement  Decades ago, a woman named Anat Baniel began studying the relationship between movement and the brain.    She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research. You’ll also be able to safely explore embodiment techniques and integration practices, and engage in revered ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices for deep healing and expanding your consciousness.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is your source for trusted information on this rapidly changing approach to mental wellness and spiritual connectedness.    Together we’ll weave a safe and knowledgeable foundation to empower you to tap into your innate healing intelligence… expand your consciousness… and connect with your true self alongside a community of like-minded seekers.  Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.    Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.    The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.

Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Experience the transformative power of energy medicine to transmute disruptive energies and emotions, in order to become an empowered, intentional co-creator of your life.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Energy Codes for Mastering the Unknown&quot;  We are living in challenging times. Uncertainty and the anxiety-provoking unknown loom large, in every area of our lives – perhaps more than ever before!      Is this the new normal?    And how do we navigate it from a place of creativity and mastery?    Even in the midst of chaos, we can make smart choices to keep ourselves safe and sane. We can still choose to be powerful co-creators of our lives — not merely survivors, or victims of circumstances beyond our control.    The truth is, you can learn to harness your energetic potential — your raw life-force energy — to grow your capacity to:      Ground    Heal    And recreate yourself (and life) in each moment    That’s why now, more than ever, it’s important to expand your perception of who you are, and why you are here, at this moment in time.    Challenge the belief that you’re just a three-dimensional person to whom “life is happening.” Rise up, and become familiar with your true identity as a multidimensional, energetic being who plays an active part in co-creating a future you really want.  How Your Energy Powers &amp; Shapes Your Life  Your energy — whether stirred by feelings you label good or bad — is the source-fuel that powers and shapes your life. And when you know how to access that power, you can manifest, call-in, and create what you want with greater ease.    According to bioenergetic medicine pioneer Dr. Sue Morte, you must learn to release “the story” that keeps you stuck and imprisoned in limitations and past versions of yourself. Open yourself up to allow in new experiences and new possibilities. Allow yourself to rebirth a new you!    Free up the energy being used to support the limited version of yourself and life. Instead, use your energy to transmute difficult feelings, like fear, anger, frustration, or grief, into waves of grace and creativity — supporting you in creating a new, harmonious and wonderful life.    Learning to direct and master the energy that IS you, makes life so much more fun!    And when you can connect to this virtually limitless grid, you can direct this transformative energy into whichever area of your life you’d like to heal, transform, evolve, refresh, or upgrade.  Benefits of Using the Energy Codes  That’s where the Energy Codes® come in...    Based on decades of research into the human body, biofield, and higher-level energy systems, the Energy Codes® offer a spiritually grounded way to tap into the deeper currents of energy that can shift anything in your life.    Ancient healing modalities have shown what modern science is now validating more and more – that moving your energy is the key to healing imbalances and dis-ease in the body.    When you learn to access and work with your energy in an intentional way (through breath, visualization, and postures) you can actually treat the root cause of your dis-ease, versus just the symptoms.    Mastering your energy can also enhance your:      Relationships    Creativity    Intuition    Manifesting power    During this free online spiritual healing class with bioenergetic medicine pioneer Dr. Sue Morter, you’ll discover insights and practices to help you tap into your true radiant, energetic self — pure unconditional love and light.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Class Topics for &quot;Energy Codes for Mastering the Unknown&quot;  When you tune in to this self-empowering hour with Dr. Sue, you’ll experience:      A breathing practice to instantly tap into what you’re feeling right now, discover where that emotion settles in your body, and help you move its energy for a sustainable sense of wellbeing    A bioenergetic body positioning practice that resets the nervous system to help integrate this breathwork practice into your neurocircuitry for results that last    How to work with chaotic energies in your system by finding your deeper truth — to transcend “the story” your mind is telling you and allow in healing energy    Ways to interpret even very difficult situations as occurring for your benefit — and turn them into energies that serve and empower    How to increase your health, vitality, and power working with the very emotional states you’ve been trying to avoid — and claim your creatorship vs. remaining a victim of circumstances    Over 40 years, Dr. Sue has taught tens of thousands of people the Energy Codes®, and brings a gracious, grounded, and authentic presence to her programs.    TheEnergy Codes® allow you to become a steward of your raw energy flow — with healing and transformation occurring as a by-product.    Instead of treating or analyzing only the symptoms (internal and external), you can experience healing by embodying and sustaining your life force.    You begin to see chronic health conditions, difficult relationships, or trauma simply as patterns of energy that can be shifted and transmuted.    During this free virtual energy healing workshop with Dr. Sue, she’ll show you that when you can “teach your mind” how to read your energy flow, you can:      Help your brain build new neurocircuitry    Access your true intuitive guidance    And become more empowered in co-creating your life    No matter the state of world affairs or your current circumstances!    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Energy Medicine Teacher - Dr. Sue Morter  Dr. Sue Morter, an international speaker, master of bioenergetic theory, and quantum field visionary, utilizes the embodiment of high-frequency energy patterns to activate full human potential.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.    Yes, we are mortal creatures, but until it is time to get our wings, we can live vibrant and active lives.    You already have heard of older people who accomplish extraordinary things, whether,      running marathons    inventing breakthroughs    writing books    taking on massive new projects    starting an exciting new career    finding new love…    That is possible for nearly everyone and is validated by modern science and neuroscience.    You will learn simple &amp; subtle movements that will wake up and rewire your brain.    During this free health class you will gently transform physical, cognitive, and emotional patterns of movement, thinking, beliefs, and emotions that cause most of the issues involving mobility, flexibility, strength, and pain.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Benefits of Using NeuroMovement  These simple movements will activate your brain for improved brain functioning, which will lead to      A renewed enthusiasm for learning    Improve cognitive abilities    Peak performance    Pain-free mobillty    More energy    Sharper thinking    Enhanced awareness    Joy and enthusiasm    Will you have to do these NeuroMovements every day for the rest of your life? No!    Do them now, see immediate results, and do them again when you want to up your vitality anytime in the future.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  How Anat Baniel Discovered NeuroMovement  Decades ago, a woman named Anat Baniel began studying the relationship between movement and the brain.    She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.

Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns.

She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.

She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "As you age, you want to      Walk with increased ease, strength, speed, improved balance, and without a walker    Watch TV without falling asleep, visit family, go to ball games or concerts, walk through the park, travel    Think more clearly, have greater awareness, and easily learn to use that new phone.    You want to be healthy, active, and feel vibrantly good. And not just once in a while. What if you could feel wonderful every day?    Anat Baniel developed a NeuroMovement system to get the brain working better and actually prevent (even reverse!) a lot of the symptoms so many people experience as they age.    You can use the system free of all charge over five days in the first ever Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Here are common symptoms of aging that CAN be improved with NeuroMovement      Aches and pains    You don\'t have to suffer with persistent issues with the neck, back, knees, feet, and other parts of the body.      Difficulty with movement &amp; diminishing flexibility    It’s challenging to get things out of upper cabinets, walk up and down stairs, pick things up, get down to the floor and get back up, get in and out of chairs, tie your shoes, or fast moving back and forth.      Getting slower and not wanting to move    Children are movement machines, but as we age, we move less and less, and eventually movement becomes a conscious effort. Both our mind and body seem to be behind the curve.      Losing strength and stamina    It becomes harder to open a jar, carry stuff, play golf, rake the yard, make the bed, push or pull, walk up a hill, and use our hands for more delicate coordination.      Feeling that life is getting smaller and closing in on us.    We don’t want to go anywhere, we don’t want to learn, we get tired of this or tired of that, it’s harder to cognitively catch things that go by quickly, harder to follow conversations with unfamiliar content.      Feelings of hopelessness, thinking things will only get worse    We feel the best years are behind us. We think we have to act old. We believe life is for younger generations.    That all happens when we get stuck in our habitual patterns. Change the patterns in your brain and you will reverse those symptoms of aging    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Why Attend the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement HealingFest  It is so easy to fall into patterns. It is so easy to believe the symptoms of aging are inevitable and irreversible.    But, they are not. You can slow and reverse those symptoms by creating new connections in your brain in a way that turns you into a powerful learner, more like when you were a young child.    You can change the trajectory of aging and ways of being that weren’t there before, even when you were younger.    Yes, we are mortal creatures, but until it is time to get our wings, we can live vibrant and active lives.    You already have heard of older people who accomplish extraordinary things, whether,      running marathons    inventing breakthroughs    writing books    taking on massive new projects    starting an exciting new career    finding new love…    That is possible for nearly everyone and is validated by modern science and neuroscience.    You will learn simple &amp; subtle movements that will wake up and rewire your brain.    During this free health class you will gently transform physical, cognitive, and emotional patterns of movement, thinking, beliefs, and emotions that cause most of the issues involving mobility, flexibility, strength, and pain.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  Benefits of Using NeuroMovement  These simple movements will activate your brain for improved brain functioning, which will lead to      A renewed enthusiasm for learning    Improve cognitive abilities    Peak performance    Pain-free mobillty    More energy    Sharper thinking    Enhanced awareness    Joy and enthusiasm    Will you have to do these NeuroMovements every day for the rest of your life? No!    Do them now, see immediate results, and do them again when you want to up your vitality anytime in the future.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  How Anat Baniel Discovered NeuroMovement  Decades ago, a woman named Anat Baniel began studying the relationship between movement and the brain.    She figured out how to intentionally activate positive brain change (what is called neuroplasticity) for making the seemingly impossible become possible.    Anat discovered that doing movements slowly and gently with attention to what you feel as you move, wakes up the brain to rapidly create millions of new connections.    This helps bring about rapid learning and, at times, seemingly miraculous breakthroughs in overcoming limitations due accidents, bad habits, and a variety of conditions, even when in some cases doctors say there is little hope.    It is all about expanding the repertoire of what your brain can tell your body to do and then being able to do it harmoniously, effortlessly, and without pain and suffering.    And during the Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging NeuroMovement Healingfest you will be able to use Anat Baniel’s NeuroMovement for Vitality &amp; Anti-Aging, all free of charge.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Teacher - Anat Baniel  Anat Baniel is the founder of Anat Baniel Method NeuroMovement, a powerful practice that takes advantage of the brain’s remarkable ability to change itself to heal body and mind. She studied clinical psychology and statistics, was trained as a dancer, and was a close professional associate of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. While still living in Israel, Anat worked with wounded war veterans, helping them recover lost mobility, overcome pain and limitation, and experience enhanced wellbeing.    Over the past 30 years, Anat has helped thousands of people from stroke patients to high-performing athletes overcome pain and reach new heights of performance, both physical and mental. She has seen remarkable outcomes in people with chronic pain, physical injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and limitations due to stroke or aging, as well as in high-performing athletes, musicians, dancers, business people, and others.    Anat’s work is at the forefront of the emerging brain plasticity field, helping wake up the brain to its greater potency for learning and change throughout life. Her innovative, scientifically based approach provides concrete and easy-to-use tools—the Nine Essentials—that enable adults (and children) to move beyond their limitations, making the seemingly impossible possible.    Anat is the author of the bestselling book Move Into Life and the acclaimed Kids Beyond Limits. She has trained hundreds of practitioners in this method. Anat and her team are currently collaborating with neuroscientists and technology experts on developing a neuroscience, neuroplasticity approach to rehabilitation. She and her team work out of the Anat Baniel Method Center in San Rafael, California.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    Affiliate Disclosure: We are grateful to be of service and bring you these life-changing events free of charge.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "Get free access to all 40+ teachers &amp; experts who will help you:      Heal trauma    Discover new ways to access creativity    Regulate your nervous system    Experience mental &amp; physical healing    Deepen your spiritual connection    The Master Plant Experience is concentrated in three areas: spirituality/personal development, experiential with embodiment practices and ceremonies, and science/medicine so they can make informed choices for their body and treatment.  Click here to register for free.  What You\'ll Learn During the &quot;Master Plant Experience&quot;  It has long been known among indigenous cultures that when people forget their place in the web of life without taking the time to remember and renew their connection with the sacred, illness and imbalances arise.    And we’re seeing the impacts of this disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Simply put, we have lost our village.    Dr. Maya Shetreat, who is a rare combination of integrative neurologist, herbalist, and spiritual teacher is putting together an event to help us all remedy overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection: The Master Plant Experience: The Science, Safety, and Sacred Ceremony of Psychedelics.    While many people automatically think that psychedelics means taking drugs recreationally or “tripping,” Dr. Maya takes a different, more sacred approach. While macrodosing may be right for some, she teaches that Master Plants can offer lessons through microdosing, quantum dosing, or even simply honoring and learning from the Plants in ceremony without ingesting them at all.    That’s right, Master Plants have long been known as ancient teachers with mycelial messages of connection to help us to navigate the challenges of this very moment.    Some of the world’s greatest thinkers, teachers and artists are joining her to speak on this topic: Bruce Lipton, Lynn McTaggart, Louie Schwartzberg of Fantastic Fungi, the famous psychedelic artists Alex and Allyson Grey, Shamini Jain, Eileen McCusick, Jeffrey Bland, Mark Hyman, Kiran Krishnan, poet Sophie Strand, the Brothers Koren, Luisah Teish, Tony Bossis, Anita Sanchez, and many, many more wonderful people.    We’ll explore:      The science and safety of psychedelics    Who Plant Medicines are best suited for and who should avoid them    What ceremony is and how it can heal us    Is microdosing effective    The difference between macrodosing and microdosing    What is quantum dosing    How probiotics &amp; gut health can impact a psychedelic experience    The benefits of reconnecting with nature    How to best support a life of connectedness and community    Discover that none of us is alone - each of us is Me and We    Ways to bring more connection and community into your life    How music and movement can act as a healing modality    What the biofield is and how it connects us    Who Plant Medicines may be for and who they are not for    How Master Plants influence mitochondria, your heart, and your quantum biology    Music and movement as a healing modality    Caring for your biofield    Approaches to healing trauma including family constellation therapy, tapping, and homeopathy    How to heal trauma through family constellation therapy    Best of all, the Master Plant Experience won’t feel intense, rushed, or packed with too much information but rather like a journey into profound and practical wisdom.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on EXPERIENCES that will regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.  Benefits of Conscious &amp; Intentional Plant Medicine Use  Imagine a life where you are:      Being supported in navigating the challenges of daily life    Regulating your nervous system    Honoring your connections and relationships    Feeling more gratitude and inviting more joy and love into your life    Rediscovering connection with yourself, your relationships, and nature    Healing and releasing difficult emotions and trauma    Helping restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth    Click here to register for free.  How The Master Plant Experience Works  This event is meant to gently guide you through the process, while offering moments of relaxation and healing.    Each day will unfold with just a couple of truly deep conversations, many of which will include hands-on experience to help regulate your nervous system, open your heart, and expand your soul.    Daily experiences include:      An opening and closing ceremony    Daily journal prompts    Biofield tuning    Singing and music    Writing your heart’s own song    Art as a channel for sharing your soul    Chanting and toning    Meditation    Group reiki    Movement    Tapping    Storytelling and myth for our journeys of healing    In other words, the Master Plant Experience is the fabulous two week retreat you’ve been longing for... and that you can access from your very own home, and at no cost to you! No pressure, no stress, just a ceremonial experience that will change your life.    As we reclaim the interactive process of ceremony helps us to honor our connections and relationships, each one of us who engages in this way of being in the world helps to restore the web of life and right relationship with living beings and the Earth.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Natural Health  Remember when we used to think microbes were all bad and being sterile was best…and then we realized that microbes within and on our bodies protect us from developing dementia, diabetes, obesity, autoimmunity and even cancer?    Even mycelium - the “wood wide web” of fungi that live under the forest floor connecting all trees and plants to one another - has captured our imagination because we’re seeing how nature works in community.    Modern science has been showing us again and again what indigenous knowledge has been saying since time immemorial: we are all deeply interconnected.    Yet these days, we’re living in a state of disconnection daily, causing epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention watching Mother Earth facing her own challenges.    The Master Plant Experience was created specifically to help us all remedy the overwhelm, reverse despair and rediscover connection. Psychedelics are also showing incredible success in reversing depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, OCD, eating disorders, and even dementia.  Click here to register for free.  Psychedelics and Mental Wellness  Did you know that a recent study showed that loneliness is as deadly as smoking cigarettes? And we don’t have to be alone to experience loneliness - we only have to feel alone.    We see the impacts of this sense of disconnection daily, through epidemics of anxiety, depression, addiction, loneliness, chronic illness, not to mention that Mother Earth is facing her own challenges.    Yet the collective response - so far - has been to do more of what we have been doing, just with greater intensity and effort, and hoping things would turn out differently. Not surprisingly, that hasn’t really done the trick.    What we really need is to experiment with new, softer perspectives and allow ourselves to explore new territory with an open heart.  Click here to register for free.  What is The Master Plant Experience?  Now in its fourth year, The Master Plant Experience is a 15-day online transformational, healing event designed for practitioners, patients, and the interested to learn about Master Plants in a balanced, responsible, and respectful way.    Psychedelics have been making headlines for reversing everything from treatment-resistant depression, anxiety, and PTSD to addiction, migraine, and cluster headaches, and even dementia.    How can you navigate the hype, find healing safely, and learn if they are right for you, your loved ones, or even clients or patients?    Master Plants are an indigenous way of referring to these powerful, neuroactive flora and fungi that instigate transformation within us and that are considered wise (and sometimes demanding) teachers and guides to humans.    Though Master Plants are by no means limited to psychedelics (think coffee and cacao!) This event will mostly explore the most cutting edge science and safety data — as well as sacred ceremony — around psychedelics.    The Master Plant Experience also aims to share the nuances of how to support yourself physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually in partnership with plant medicine so that you’ll learn to navigate the hype and find healing safely and decide whether it’s right for you or not.    Together, we will create a respectful, responsible, and educated community that understands these Master Plants are more than just a magic pill.    Would you like to learn ways to build your own relationship to the wisdom and ancient wonders of Master Plants, so you can experience a life filled with more wisdom and enchantment?    Master Plants are calling for us to cultivate reverence, gratitude, reciprocity, and kinship with ourselves, each other, the land, and the invisible.    Please Note: This is not a pitch to take psychedelics. The goal is to share openly with you a balanced and responsible view of psychedelics and master plants, so you can make an informed decision for yourself.  Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Access the wisdom of archetypal astrology to deeply understand yourself and the nature of reality with two of the great minds of our time.    Astrology has been given a bad rap by academia…    Yet a deeper understanding of astrology can help us navigate our times of greatest challenge and point the way to hidden resources.    It\'s also been championed by some of history’s greatest intellectual pioneers, from Galileo and Kepler to Ptolemy and Plotinus.    Is it time to finally take astrology seriously and accept that it may point the way to a paradigm shift in how we view ourselves and the nature of the cosmos?    Stanislav Grof, the founder of transpersonal psychology, and noted philosopher Rick Tarnas agree that archetypal astrology offers a unique and precise way to explore the depths of our psyche and the patterns that govern our culture.    Though their experience and expertise differ — research into non-ordinary states of consciousness and immersion in the history of Western thought, respectively — they agree that archetypal astrology offers a unique and precise way to explore the depths of our psyche and the patterns that govern our culture.    These two renowned intellects will show you how to harness the power of archetypal astrology to deeply understand yourself AND make meaning of our times during their FREE online event, Is Archetypal Astrology the Rosetta Stone of the Human Psyche? Illuminating Your Depths, Navigating Our Times.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  What You\'ll Learn During Your Archetypal Astrology Class      When Grof studied people’s experiences in his groundbreaking research into non-ordinary states, the only system that proved to have any predictive value was astrology.    Similarly, when Tarnas delved into the history of Western civilization, he began to see that the larger patterns of our cultural evolution had predictable rhythms that closely correlated with planetary cycles and astrological archetypes.    Their work goes beyond “sun-sign” pop astrology...    And addresses the larger tectonic forces at the depths of the psyche, a subject that C. G. Jung also explored in depth.    During this fascinating hour, Grof and Tarnas will share:      How archetypal astrology shifts us beyond linear causation to a more synchronistic view compatible with an interconnected, meaningful, and intelligent universe    Why history seems to repeat itself; for instance, why is the United States in such a state of political tumult right now and how does it connect to other times of tumult such as the 1960s?    How astrology can give you a deeper sense of the meaning behind times of real challenges such as spiritual emergencies and “dark nights of the soul”… and how to tap into the wisdom of    astrology to navigate through them    Why astrology is an invaluable tool to support your deepest explorations with non-ordinary states of consciousness    You’ll begin to see how astrology can help shift your perception of the universe from random and capricious to intelligent and orderly, leaving you feeling blessed instead of stressed!    So what’s really going on with archetypal astrology? Could academia be unwittingly preventing a major paradigm shift that points the way to an intelligent, ensouled universe, with astrology holding the master key?    In this exciting public event featuring two renowned intellects, you’ll discover more about how to harness the power of archetypal astrology to deeply understand yourself and make meaning of our times.  Benefits of Using Archetypal Astrology In Your Life      Navigate your times of greatest challenge    Direct you to hidden resources    Identify the most auspicious times for key decisions and actions    Find value, purpose, and courage in your darkest days    Shift your perception of the universe from random and capricious to intelligent and orderly    Feel blessed instead of stressed    So do join these two celebrated intellectuals as they lead you into a deeper understanding of life, new awareness of the underlying forces at work in our depths, and a healing recognition that we live in an “ensouled” universe.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  About Your Archetypal Astrology Teachers - Stanislav Grof and Rick Tarnas  About Stanislov Grof  Stanislav Grof, MD, is a clinical psychiatrist with over 50 years of experience in researching non-ordinary states of consciousness induced by psychedelic substances and by experiential psychotherapy.

Testimonials for Stanislov Grof and Rick Tarnas  &quot;I know of no work that so well incorporates the findings of Freud, Jung, and Rank, adding fresh insights, which the methods of those psychotherapists could never have achieved. I do not doubt that many others working in this field would find Dr. Grof\'s discoveries a basis for a whole new strategy of research.&quot; — Joseph Campbell    &quot;Breathtaking in the scope and scale of its vision, [Rick Tarnas’] extraordinary book shatters our cosmological assumptions... spellbinding, eloquent, compelling.&quot; — Christopher Bache    &quot;Grof marshals an impressive array of data and speculation in support of the timely demand that Western science acknowledge consciousness and its many non-ordinary states.&quot; — Richard Alpert (Ram Dass)    &quot;Grof has had far and away more experience in psychedelic research than anyone else and has come up with the most comprehensive and helpful framework for interpreting the data in this bewildering area.&quot; — Huston Smith    &quot;Tarnas writes lucidly, brilliantly, passionately, unfolding the great drama of the evolution of the Western mind act by act, scene by scene in precise and scholarly detail.&quot; — Anne Baring    &quot;It’s hard to think of many books written in the past century that will still be read 200 years from now. [Rick Tarnas’] Cosmos and Psyche will top that short list. It is majestic, sweeping and profound. This will be a book for the ages. It will stand over time with the seminal expressions of the human spirit.&quot; — William Van Dusen Wishard  =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend the scheduled session... 🌟    Register now because you\'ll be able to get a copy of the recording afterwards.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums.

Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "You may already know that dream shamanism reveals how your dreams are an entire world that you can cultivate as you wish…    Yet, did you know that welcoming the honeybee as your guide through your intentional dreaming practices can help you develop a deeper, more profound relationship with yourself, Spirit, and the Earth?    The ancient practice of bee shamanism, an ancient branch of shamanism, is revered throughout the world — wherever the honeybee is found.    Especially in this current historical moment of profound change and imbalance with the Earth, bee shamanism continues to reveal powerful truths and insights we can apply to our daily lives.    In this free virtual Shamanism class, Ariella Daly, shamanic practitioner, writer, and bee guardian, will introduce you to the bee shamanism tradition, the Path of Pollen, in a fascinating 60-minute event:    Approach Dreamwork Through the Practices of Bee Shamanism: Techniques from the Bee Priestess Lineage of Ancient Greece to Deepen Your Relationship With Yourself, Spirit &amp; the Earth.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During This Free Virtual Bee Shamanism Class      How the ancient tradition of bee shamanism connects you more deeply to your body — and unlocks profound wisdom about everything from the cosmos to the personal inner work you’re being called to do    The history and potentially life-changing significance of the Melissae, the bee priestesses — also known as the womb shamans    The dream incubation practices of ancient Greece — and the long-ago revelation that bees are intimately connected to dreams    The fascinating story of why the honeybee is sacred, the role of the figure eight in bee shamanism as the primary symbol of the bee tradition, and more    How to infuse your dreams with a guided Fire-Sipping practice, a technique for bringing the energy of fire in the form of a beeswax candle into the body as a sacred temple, focusing on a part of your body that needs attention    Ariella will share how dreaming with bees can uniquely affect your dream state, the importance of honeybees as sacred beings in the ancient world and folklore...    And why bees are so important to humankind today.    You’ll discover how, just as the honeybee tends to its garden, you can tend to your own interior garden...    And learn more about the world and who you truly are through bee shamanism and intentional dreaming.    You\'ll explore the hidden depths of your interior garden through the ancient tradition of bee shamanism...    Of which Dreamwork is an integral part...    To deepen into your own truth, intuition, and healing.  Shamanism, Your Interior Garden, and Intentionally Dreaming  Ariella is an expert at helping you explore the hidden depths of your Interior Garden through the ancient European tradition of bee shamanism — as you learn to intentionally dream within the Dream Weave to dive deeper into your creativity, intuition, and healing.    As a shamanic dreamer, you can enter the dreamworld to connect with your guides, travel across time and space, and return to your waking life with newfound wisdom, insight, and inspiration.    And when you connect with honeybees as your guides in your dreams, you can develop a deeper relationship with yourself, Spirit, and the Earth.    Bee shamanism has its roots in Celtic Britain, Lithuania, and ancient Greece, where it experienced a golden age among the bee priestesses known as the Melissae, which translates to “Bees.”    In these days of uncertainty, change, and imbalance in our relationship with the Earth, bee shamanism holds powerful truths and insights you can apply to your daily life right away.    Intentional dreaming is an element of shamanic work beloved by many folk traditions, including European bee shamanism. As you’ll discover, when you choose to intentionally dream with spirit allies such as the honeybees and the Melissae, you learn to engage with the more-than-human world of guides, messengers, and symbols. These dream allies can lead you deeper into your inner wisdom, healing, and self-discovery.    Through this ancient tradition, you’ll discover the potent insights of your own Interior Garden, and connect more deeply to your body to unlock profound wisdom — about everything from the cosmos to the personal inner work you’re meant to embark on.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Shamanism Teacher - Ariella Daly  Ariella Daly is a dream weaver and bee tender.

Testimonials for Ariella Daly  &quot;My experience of working with Ariella is one of utmost integrity, commitment, and devotion to the work. She holds a deeply nurturing and safe container for the students who have undertaken our events, and very much holds herself to a gold standard that makes working with her an absolute pleasure. The intimacy of her relationship to bee shamanism is tangible and underlines all that she transmits in her work. For those who cannot physically experience the bees, they are no doubt felt when in contact, remotely or otherwise, with Ariella.&quot; — Gabriela Gutierrez    &quot;The dreamwork courses I participated in with Ariella over the last couple of years have opened me up into a world of healing, insight, and homecoming that has touched me deeply and been a soothing balm for my soul. Her skill and ability to support a group navigating through the dreamtime was excellent and very professional, and I highly recommend the journeys she offers. Step into the dark with her and be illuminated!&quot; — Carol    &quot;Ariella’s dreaming classes are transformative. There is life-changing power in the circles she creates and holds. The dreaming classes are like bathing in a sacred soundscape, which in our world of Zoom meetings feels all the more luxurious. Having my own dream alchemized by the dreaming circle was a life-changing experience. I still sit in the alchemy of that dream months later, and gratefully continue practices I learned in her class on a regular basis.&quot; — Heather N.    &quot;Ariella’s dreamwork courses are magical and empowering. This is truly the best way to describe them! I am so grateful for Ariella’s ability to hold space for everyone just as they are, and for her gift in acting as a guide into the realm of mystery and inner knowing. Each class session has filled my heart with soul poetry. This healing balm has been an incredible treasure that’s continued to unfold in my waking life, as well as in the dreamtime. Within these courses, I have learned so much about herstory, symbolism, myth, and magic, in addition to our responsibility of being in relationship with the earth and our fellow creatures. I have also learned a great deal about how to tune in to my own place of intuition and how to trust myself. Thank you so much for setting a beautiful example with your authentic and genuine expression of this work!&quot; — Breanna    &quot;I was fortunate to take two classes from Ariella: Dreaming With Bees and Betwixt and Between. Both classes were powerful transformational experiences for me. Due to various reasons I had not dreamt much for a long period of time, and Ariella’s classes helped me to touch back into my dreaming self again. She is an excellent space holder with the depth of her wisdom and gentle presence. I highly recommend working with her in whatever capacity you are called to! Ariella is a rare gem of a teacher and I’m so grateful to have experienced her work.&quot; — Tara    &quot;Ariella’s Dreaming With Bees class is a delicious communion of inner and outer realms, the way she weaves together the gifts of the hive. The whole experience offered me a taste of bee magic and encouraged me to discover more of their medicine on my own. During our time together I witnessed myself open to new possibilities, new perspectives, and new interpretations of the symbols curated by the bees and their gentle spirits. Every week was a sweet reminder of why I’m committed to serving the honeybee in dreaming and waking hours, and how to continue walking between the worlds. I would recommend this course for anyone who is even slightly intrigued by bees, dreaming, or magic!&quot; — Karla  Ariella Day Answers: What\'s The Nicest Thing a Stranger Has Ever Done For You?      ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to get the recording afterwards.

 "description": "Discover how to harness your life force to remove the blocks to your full potential...  And go to your next level of self-expression, power, intuition and more.        Click here to register for free.      What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Supercharge Your Chakras&quot;  We’re all fueled by life force energy. Yogis call it prana; Asian healers call it chi or ki; Freud called it libido.    We experience this energy when we’re excited or scared as the vital charge that flows through us — or we notice its absence when we’re depressed or exhausted.    Most of us, due to psychological wounding, have created blockages in our bodies that stops us from receiving the full flow of our life force.    But did you know you have the power within you to direct the flow of your energy — dialing it up or down as needed to create, heal, awaken, inspire and much more?    And when you bring together your ability to harness life force with an understanding of the chakra system, you are supercharged to free yourself from limitations and become the full expression of who you really are — healthy, joyful, energized and inspired!    If you long to not only have more energy throughout the day and feel more healthy, vital and comfortable in your body but also to unlock the deeper potentials throughout your chakra system (such as being ecstatically connected to the Divine) — the good news is that there’s a “user’s manual” that can help you heal your energy system and unleash it’s full power.    The chakra system is a profound map for your journey of personal growth. It’s based on your body’s seven major energy centers, which run from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. When properly aligned and activated, these seven energy centers can supercharge your body with revitalizing life force energy.    Perhaps you know a little about your chakra system but have never been given a clear and cohesive overview of how to balance and activate your chakras and use them to power your life.    Consequently, you may have imbalances, blockages or behavioral patterns sabotaging your energy, confidence or grounding, which manifest as fatigue, confusion or fear.    In fact, many of our most challenging emotions — from fear to guilt to shame — have a strong hold on our energy system (often since our childhood), and until we work with them on an energetic level, they’ll continue to undermine our health and happiness.    Fortunately, Anodea Judith, author of the #1 bestselling book on chakras, Wheels of Life, is offering a free virtual event that combines her latest teachings on “charge” with her acclaimed work on chakras.    The result? Precise insights to supercharge your chakras!    This event is a wonderful opportunity to receive essential nuggets of wisdom and practices you can apply for optimizing your energy system, which impacts your emotional, psychological and spiritual wellbeing.    Anodea’s insights will show you how to align with the deepest wellspring of energies in your body-mind to awaken your consciousness — and incorporate practices that allow you to charge up your chakras quickly and easily.    Even more exciting, this will be a video event, so you can both hear and see Anodea, enhancing the impact of her transmissions and her demonstration of practices.  Class Topics for &quot;Supercharge Your Chakras&quot;  After nearly 40 years of teaching this work, Anodea knows exactly what works (and what doesn’t) to light up your energy centers with power and precision.    The insights and techniques Anodea will reveal are useful to anyone who wants to harness their energy to enhance their wellbeing, relationships, sex life, power, vitality and creativity.    When you join this free virtual event, you’ll discover:      A quick overview of the chakra system that resonates intuitively and works with Western psychology    The specific health and body challenges associated with each chakra — and practices that can address and heal each of them    How to differentiate between too much and too little “charge” in your system, and balance your life force appropriately    Ways to work with energetic blocks, and how to shift them more gracefully    If you’ve been looking for a powerful approach to healing and personal growth that enables more integration, wholeness and balance of your energies, this is the event for you!    After nearly 40 years of study, personal practice and teaching, Anodea knows exactlywhat works (and what doesn’t).      Click here to register for free.

 "description": "Discover your ability to remove the blocks to physical health, financial abundance, and intuitive guidance... and liberate the true healer and creator within you.    Imagine creating your entire life experience moment by moment…        …and releasing the story that your mind’s been telling you about what is and isn’t possible. Let\'s be clear: You don’t “have” energy. You are energy. Pure, Spirit energy. The lives and teachings of mystics, philosophers, and healers through the ages have illuminated this fact. For centuries, Chinese medicine has focused on restoring and balancing the flow of energy, or Qi, along the body’s meridians. Ayurveda, hands-on healing traditions, shamanism, and other disciplines work with energy fields, too. And now science, through quantum physics, also validates the existence of subtle fields of energy beyond matter, atoms, and swirling electrons. The root cause of emotional, physical, and spiritual challenges — from stress at work to discord in relationships to chronic pain to financial lack — is energy; or rather, these challenges are the result of subtle blockages within your body’s energy field. Yet, did you know YOU have an innate capacity to heal... ... to release “the limiting story” your mind is telling you about what is and isn’t possible for you... ... and to fully master the energy that is you?        It all begins with working with the energy patterns that form your experiences.        That’s because the root of emotional and physical challenges — from stress at work to discord in relationships to chronic pain and financial lack — is energy.        Or rather, these challenges are the result of subtle blockages within your body’s energy field.        And it’s possible for you to remove subconscious and energetic blocks to your health, achievement, and manifestation.        To help you do so, Dr. Sue Morter developed her world-renowned Energy Code teachings… so you can clear the way for profound healing and the ability to co-create EVERYTHING in your life.        Dr. Sue — an early pioneer of Energy Medicine and bioenergetics — will present Discover the Next Level of Energy Medicine: Clear Hidden Blocks in Your Energy Circuitry to Liberate Your Inner Healer, Intuitive Guidance &amp; Power to Manifest.        ===================================↘️Click here to register for free. ↙️===================================        What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Discover the Next Level of Energy Medicine&quot; With Dr. Sue Morter          The missing link in stewarding the energetics of your life for greater health and vitality  Your ability to remove blocks to your health, achievement, and manifestation by building new neural-circuitry in your body  Breathing techniques that allow you to defuse stress and shift out of “fight or flight” to access your powerful healing Self  How to address the deep energetic causes of health issues instead of the symptoms  How to operate outside of time by activating the creatorship capacity in your brain to work with things that have not yet come to pass…          According to Dr. Sue, you’re meant to be an active, ever-present steward of this flow of energy... And through her signature Energy Codes teachings, Dr. Sue can teach you how to do this by combining conscious breathing exercises, energy work, and subtle body awareness practices to remove blockages in your nervous system and subconscious memory storage. A world-renowned quantum-field visionary, Dr. Sue teaches people to recognize and work with the subconscious or unconscious lower frequency patterns that may be creating relationship issues, emotional stress, physical illness, chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and more. You can then “teach your mind” how to listen, perceive, and read your energy flow to access your true intuitive guidance.        As Dr. Sue says, the Energy Codes enable you to “build a set of circuitry so you can live from deep, intuitive space, always guiding your lifefrom a higher vibrational frequency.”  You don\'t need a guru and you don\'t need a miracle. You ARE already both. — Dr. Sue Morter        The Energy Codes empower you to take full ownership of the energy that you are at your very core. They’re a powerful set of simple principles and practices that take The Law of Attraction and “You Create Your Own Reality” to the next level.  And here’s what’s really amazing — Dr. Sue affirms that healing of any kind, from your body to your relationships, is a byproduct of “removing the gunk” within your energy field. No more “working on your issues,” or trying to “fix what’s broken.” Instead, daily practices stimulate your central nervous system and electromagnetic field — opening the gateway between your conscious and subconscious mind.  The result is deep healing and an awakening to your true role as a co-creator of EVERYTHING in your life. Once you master the Energy Codes, you’ll continuously build new neurocircuitry — and expand into greater possibilities for your life. You’ll begin to easily discern...    Which people and situations to say “yes” (or “no”) to...  The goals and projects to manifest, or not, based on how they “land” energetically  Places you should go, or not, based on their resonance with this inner circuitry and the ways Spirit is guiding you    If you’re ready to take full ownership of the energy that you ARE…        ===================================↘️Click here to register for free. ↙️===================================  Manifesting Easier Using Energy Medicine  Are you able to create everything you want out of life? Do you feel that everything you do feeds you, and gives you a sense of purpose and fulfillment?  Or... are you curious about how to create something that you feel is missing — something that would enrich you, nourish your family, and improve the world around you?  Your ability to manifest and be masterful in your life depends on how well the two systems that run your body are functioning.  We’re all very familiar with one of these systems… with modern science, we can study, dissect, diagram, and see it — our central nervous system.  The other system is less well-known. Yet, if you explore Eastern medicine and spirituality, you might already be familiar with it...  And surprisingly, it’s actually what built your central nervous system.  It’s your electromagnetic energy essence that profoundly affects your nervous system.  And if it’s chaotic... dispersed... weakened... agitated... or disconnected… then you’re merely surviving, rather than THRIVING in your innate ability to create and get everything you want out of life.  So what if you could bridge science and spirit to truly make your desires a reality?  Dr. Sue Morter, a master of bioenergetic medicine and a quantum field visionary, reveals how you can master BOTH your nervous system AND your electromagnetic essence — by building more energetic circuits...  If you want to generate your own life experience, the trick is to build more communication pathways between your two systems. You can tap into BOTH to acknowledge, ignite, create, and manifest in your life...  ===================================↘️Click here to register for free. ↙️===================================  Benefits of Learning How to Use &quot;The Energy Codes&quot;  What you\'ll learn during this free class is an excellent introduction to Dr. Sue Morter\'s &quot;Energy Codes&quot; system. When you go deeper into her teachings, and apply the Energy Codes in your life, you\'ll see tremendous benefits. For starters, you\'ll learn how to tap into the quantum field to expand your capacity to heal and create your life anew in each moment.  So let\'s get candid...  You’re probably already aware that working at the energetic level can be extremely powerful for enhancing your health, creativity, relationships, and manifesting power.  That’s because your energy is the source-fuel that powers the rest of your life — and when you have more power, you can create whatever you want more effectively.  That’s why it’s so important to tap into the deepest level of your soul’s energy. When you can connect to this virtually limitless grid, you can move energy into whatever area of your life is most in need of upleveling.  That’s where the Energy Codes® come in. Born of decades of research into the human body, biofield, and higher-level energy systems, they offer a spiritually grounded way to tap into the deeper currents of energy that can shift anything else in your life.  The Codes allow you to access — and ultimately to direct — the energy that you need.  That\'s important because moving and directing energy is the key to healing imbalances and dis-ease in the body. When you learn to access and move energy in an intentional way through your breath, visualizations, and postures, you can treat the root cause of illness, not just the symptoms. And you can then tap your Source energy as well.  Ultimately, these Codes can create a real and lasting shift in your life, beyond merely healing — they can help you advance toward life mastery.  True life mastery and manifesting your full potential is about becoming fully intentional with your energy because you are pure, Spirit energy.  The next level of energy medicine is about building new inner circuitry that powers a new version of yourself... living AS energy and manifesting your life as it’s happening.  This is not an abstract process. Each part of your body holds precious gifts and deeper intelligence that can be unlocked by specific codes.  ===================================↘️Click here to register for free. ↙️===================================  What Are the Energy Codes?  The Energy Codes are a set of proven principles and practices that allow you to become a steward of your energy flow — with healing occurring as a byproduct. Instead of treating or analyzing symptoms (internal and external), you can experience healing by embodying and sustaining your life force through unlocking your Energy Codes.  You’ll begin to see chronic health conditions, difficult relationships, or trauma simply as patterns of energy... that can be shifted.  The benefits of the Energy Codes far exceed mind-body healing. Dr. Sue teaches daily practices that can stimulate your central nervous system and your electromagnetic field — opening the gateway between your conscious and subconscious mind.  Applying the Energy Codes daily, you’ll begin to:    Manifest according to your soul’s requirements  Awaken to your role as the master creator of your life  Make choices based on how opportunities land energetically  Deeply engage with your work and relationships  Heal your body-mind by becoming a steward of your energy flow    Plus, you’ll raise your vibrational field to resonate with your soul’s highest purpose.  Awaken to Your Role as Co-Creator  The most profound healing you can experience is awakening to your true role as a co-creator of everything in your life. Living as the flow of energy rather than from the limiting energy patterns within your body-mind, you’ll begin to embody a version of yourself you’ve only had a glimpse of before.  The Energy Codes will help you build the new neurocircuitry to sustain this truer Self — activating your higher brain centers and creative wavelengths of mental energy.  If you’ve tried manifesting using the Law of Attraction, visualization, and other techniques, there’s a reason the results have been less than what you envisioned for your life, it’s time to build the internal circuitry that allows you to perceive — and ACCESS — the quantum field of possibility, where all form is conceived.  The Power of the Energy Codes for Healing &amp; Manifestation  In meditation 17 years ago, Dr. Sue awakened to a new reality and version of herself as pure energy. She’s since taught thousands of people how to work with the Energy Codes.  And in the 7-module online course (which this free call introduces you to), you also can discover how to:    Read the world from an energy-based model, drop the thought, and master your innate energy flow for healing and empowerment  Identify the actual reasons for “withholds,” procrastination, fear, and tension — and learn to clear them, in only 4 minutes a day  Clear unresolved anger and find their original source — through your bioenergetics  See the body as a conduit and processor of larger energy fields  Receive new breathwork practices that free, mobilize, and move your energies, and work through distortions in your bioenergetic field  Adopt specific on-the-go techniques for unveiling past residue and unresolved subconscious interferences  Identify and move past victim stories — even the “well-adapted victim” stories that affirm “you’re doing the best you can with what you’ve got”  Build the neurocircuitry to sustain this new identity through activating your high brain centers for generating alpha thinking and perceiving      &quot;You can actually refine your ability to \'know\' before the evidence appears in the physical world.&quot; — Dr. Sue    If you want to manifest effectively, love fully, and embrace (rather than fear) the beautiful mystery of your existence as energy, you’re in the right place. You’ll develop a complete, holistic understanding of the practices, tools, and principles you’ll need to activate your Energy Codes. You’ll step into the field of expanded possibility, accessing your highest potential and living as a radiant, WHOLE being emanating love and grace.  ===================================↘️Click here to register for free. ↙️===================================  About Your Energy Medicine Teacher - Dr. Sue Morter  Dr. Sue Morter, an international speaker, master of bioenergetic medicine, and quantum field visionary, redirects the flow of energy patterns in the body to activate full human potential.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Psychedelic Healing and Consciousness  Are you excited to co-create a new normal that feels alive, healthy, and joy-filled?    As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.    While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "IMPORTANT NOTE: The 2023 Psychedelic Healing Summit is not yet available for registration. It will be available in April. Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Her magic expands consciousness through social impact campaigns, documentaries, and transformative — personally and collectively — educational curriculums. Her latest envisioned jewel is entheowheel.    Entheowheel weaves ceremony and science bridging ancient and contemporary spiritual teachings inviting in practices for deeper preparation, ceremony, and integration of future psychedelic experiences.  Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

Dream Mullick\'s Story How She Discovered Psychedelics &amp; Spiritual Growth  A bit about my journey…  “You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one”- John Lennon  I was born bridging cultures and weaving worlds, in Madras India, to an East Indian dad and a Jewish American mom. I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.

Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.

I spent most of my early years between a hippie commune in TN called The Farm and a suburban coastal town in central Florida, learning from an early age to walk between many different realms.  My parents found the inspiration for my name in John Lennon’s song Imagine, and my dreams often offer guidance and insights.  A deep connection with the beauty way of the natural world, non-ordinary spiritual realms, and other dimensions (like dreams) are foundational in my work today.  As someone who personally understands deep trauma and complex PTSD, I’m committed to mending the perceived split between self and the divine, and reconnecting with the core of who we are as Love.  All I offer is in service to cultivating a more resilient and beautiful world, weaving back together the individual as a part of the greater whole and restoring the sacred to the ordinary.  My current work focuses on the sacred bookends of birth and death along with bridging the ancient and modern science of plant and psychedelic medicines.  I’ve been deeply informed by my own experiences with Death, Sacred Plants &amp; Psychedelics, all of whom I consider my master teachers. My first experience with mushrooms, 35 years ago, continues to have a lasting impact on my life and my work with death has been greatly informed by the deaths of my father and husband.  My offerings are also supported by a variety of other studies and initiations, including: divination, dreams, death meditation, Tibetan dream yoga, business school, intuitive studies, soul retrieval, somatic trauma work, Shambala meditation, 19 ways to the 5th world, a restoration of literature and other transformational consciousness-expanding modalities.  I’m committed to our journey home. To love. To the divine. To remembering our interconnected natures. To cultivating resilience. To our individual and collective liberation. To Truth.  I spend most of my time these days in a cliffside cottage in Big Sur with my 2 cats, the Redwoods, a beautiful community, the occasional mountain lion, and the untethered Pacific Ocean.

Psychedelic healing is viewed from two distinctly related, yet different perspectives. Medically speaking, it is also known as psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, or PAP. This is a form of psychiatric treatment in which a psychedelic drug is consumed as part of a psychotherapeutic procedure. Spiritually speaking, for hundreds of years, numerous civilizations have employed hallucinogenic drugs in holistic medical and spiritual traditions. In both cases, a trained professional supports the healing journey.  What are the most frequently psychedelics used for healing?  While there are many options to choose from, the most commonly used today are: ayuhuasca, LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA (aka ecstacy).  How do you take psychedelics for healing?  Legal psychedelics should only be used under the guidance of a trained professional. At present, there is no standardized administration for psychedelics. Generally, However, there are a few common guidelines that practitioners follow:      Use of a low to moderate dosage of a psychedelic substance    Professional monitoring throughout the hallucinogenic experience    Using one to two weeks between sessions to retake the psychedelic dosage    Approach it with a sense of calm and ease    What is the best environment for taking psychedelics?  Both &quot;set&quot; and &quot;setting&quot; are essential factors for an optimal healing experience. The set refers to your mindset, emotions, moods, intentions, and expectations. That\'s about who you are going into the experience. The setting should be a place that feels relaxing, safe, and supportive. The objective is to feel at ease with both the therapist and the environment in which the session will occur.  What does it mean to &quot;integrate&quot; psychedelics?  Psychedelic healing sessions are intended to assist the person in processing, making sense of, and finding meaning in their psychedelic experience. Therefore, after a session it\'s important to allow adequate time for the experience to deepen both into the conscious and unconscious minds. Having a trained professional helps facilitate this part of the experience in positive, healthy, supportive ways.  What is microdosing?  Microdosing is a type of psychedelic healing that includes consuming very tiny, non-hallucinogenic dosages of psychedelic drugs. Proponents of micro-dosing argue that even these shallow doses can have positive health effects such as improving performance, increasing energy, and decreasing depression.  Is there any scientific evidence for the healing benefits of psychedelics?  Just a brief search for &quot;MDMA PTSA&quot; brings up a plethora of well-cited and often-quoted scholarly articles. Further digging into NIH and other medical databases shows that there\'s continued interest and study into clinical research and professional uses for psychedelics. This is likely due to the fact that the stigma behind psychedelics is continuing to fade over time.  What are the negative side effects of taking psychedelics?  While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

Until then, all links on this page will redirect to another plant medicine event that can support your growth.  As recent clinical studies have shown, psychedelic medicines have high levels of efficacy when paired with treatments like therapy in treating depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), addiction, and a range of other challenges.  While psychedelic healing is an emerging frontier of modern Western mental health and wellness, it has been an integral part of many Indigenous cultures worldwide for thousands of years, which have used psychedelics to receive wisdom and offer healing to their communities.  Many people worldwide are exploring bridging therapeutic modalities and treatments with expanded states of consciousness to clear shame and heal personal, ancestral, and collective trauma.  The Psychedelic Healing Summit is more than just the latest clinical research — this is a 4-day experiential journey into the wisdom, intelligence, and embodiment of psychedelics and plant medicine.  ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Summit Overview  You’ll experience full days dedicated to:      The history and science behind psychedelic healing    Fundamentals for the responsible use of sacred plants and psychedelics across traditions    A range of deep transformational practices and sacred rituals across lineages and ancestral heritages    An exploration of the role of sacred plants and psychedelics in dreams, breathwork, meditation, and movement    Tools for integrating your experiences into your daily life.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    Psychedelic Healing Is Becoming Mainstream  This Psychedelic Healing Summit (free!) illuminates the history, scientific research, and therapeutic integration processes of psychedelic medicine with sacred music and ceremonies, comes during an opportune time to positively impact our global mental health crisis.    The pandemic pushed rates of anxiety and depression four times higher in the U.S. alone, and many people around the world are struggling through grief, loss, and isolation. Use of anti-anxiety prescription drugs spiked more than 30% over the past two years, along with similar bumps in anti-depression and sleep aid prescriptions.    But an increasingly large market is seeking help outside the pharmaceutical industry, looking for relief from anxiety, depression, and trauma along with a connection to a higher purpose. Enter psychedelics, a movement that’s rapidly becoming mainstream thanks in part to:      Major press outlets sanctioning the movement (“Psilocybin and MDMA are poised to be the hottest new therapeutics since Prozac,” New York Times) and &quot;Psychedelic frees up depressed brain,&quot; BBC)    Prestigious medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and Yale reporting that psilocybin creates positive changes in moods, attitudes, and behavior when it comes to depression, anxiety, and addiction.    Psychedelics are now entering the mainstream as a method to address stress, burnout, anxiety, depression — as well as expand consciousness and cultivate inner peace.    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================  What You\'ll Learn During the Psychedelic Healing 2023 Summit      Improve Your Mental Wellness    Experience Deeper Connections    Manifest Your Greatest Gifts    Safely explore psychedelics as a healing modality for challenges such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and burnout    Connect with the healing intelligence of sacred plants and honor their wisdom keepers    Integrate powerful ceremonies, rituals, and at-home practices into your daily life to experience a deeper sense of belonging, wholeness, and community    Spark your creative essence, explore your gifts, and access love more fully    Reconnect with your purpose and joy as an interconnected part of a larger ecosystem    Bring healing modalities such as breathwork, movement, music, and energy medicine into your life to develop a relationship with the spirits of the medicines — even without ingesting them    Enjoy a 4-day virtual retreat-style experience as you learn about sacred plant medicine, Indigenous beliefs and traditions, and the latest psychedelic research.

While psychedelics can have powerful healing effects, they can also have side effect including, but not limited to:              Changed perception of time            Virtual illusions            Perceptually distorted sensations            Strong feelings or impressions            Insecurity            Viewing, listening or feeling things that one would not normally encounter    Not everybody will experience all, or any of those side effects. Each person is uniquely different, and this is another reason why psychedelics should only be taken under the guidance of a trained professional.    Long-term, heavy, recreational psychedelic use has been associated long-term psychosis, manifesting as visual abnormalities, flashbacks, erratic thinking, paranoia, anxiety, and mood swings. They can also produce hallucinogen persistent perception disorder (HPPD), characterized by severe hallucinations and visual abnormalities.    While these side effects can be serious, and do sound scary, they are extremely unlikely when using psychedelics specifically for healing while under the guidance of a trained professional.  Do psychedelics make you more spiritual?  Some people claim to experience mystical or spiritual experiences after using psychedelic drugs. They may express sentiments of serenity, pleasure, oneness, or empathy, and feeling connected to the Universal Oneness that connects us all.    Can psychedelics be used instead of anti-depressants?    First of all, never change your medical dosages unless you have discussed it with your doctor. There may be adverse effects combining medications and psychedelics, so it\'s important to have full information, guidance, and support before making any changes.    That said, stress, melancholy, substance abuse, alcoholism, and PTSD have all been shown in studies to react well to psychedelic-assisted therapy. Here\'s a few areas of interest that have been studied, are being studied, and would benefit from further study:      Anxiety and mood disorders: Psychedelics offer potential mood advantages that might aid with depression therapy. A 2016 rigorous double-blind controlled study discovered that psilocybin medication significantly decreased worry and sadness in cancer patients.    Alcohol and drug use disorders: Early studies indicated that LSD might aid in the rehabilitation of drug use problems. Some newer data supports the notion that psychedelic therapy has promise as an addiction treatment.     Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Research indicates that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may be beneficial for the treatment of PTSD (PTSD), so much so, that in 2017 the FDA deemed it beneficial for PTSD symptoms and called it a &quot;breakthrough therapy.&quot;    ====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  ====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to listen to replays for a full 48-hours after each session.

 "description": "    Discover how to achieve inner peace, clearheadedness, and a strong immune system.    Cultures around the world have believed the heart was the epicenter of the body and responsible for our feelings, thoughts, and behavior.    Interestingly enough, science today is starting to support this perspective, finding that our energetic heart — not our brain — acts as the gateway to our higher self.    Rollin McCraty, PhD’s work as a psycho-physiologist and Director of Research at the HearthMath Institute illustrates that feeling positive emotions like love or gratitude can put our body back in harmony and stabilize the rhythms of the heart.    In this ideal state of coherence, the heart’s electromagnetic energy transmits waves of healing, inner peace, and wellbeing that not only affects us, but others around us.    During this free virtual spirituality event, Rollin will show you what it takes to achieve “heart coherence” in Discover the Science Behind Your Heart’s Intelligence: Experience a Heart Coherence Practice to Shift from Stress &amp; Negativity to Calm &amp; Wellbeing.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  What You\'ll Learn During This Free Spiritual Healing Class      What heart coherence is and the power of it    How one of the most effective ways to be heart coherent is through emotional self-regulation    The ways in which negative and positive emotions can impact your hormonal and nervous systems    How heart coherence can positively transform each of us — and simultaneously improve social and global harmony    A quick and simple practice you can use on the fly anytime you want to self-regulate and shift into a more heart-coherent state    You’ll discover how to reach a state of balance in which the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems stop playing an unhealthy game of tug-of-war with one another...    And allow you to shift into a heart-coherent state to quickly help you focus, feel calm, and improve your state of mind.  You’ll also learn different ways to:      Better manage anxiety    Improve cognitive performance    And connect with a deeper intuitive awareness.    You’ll also learn what it takes to achieve “heart coherence...”    Where the heart, brain, and nervous system are aligned and in sync...    Giving you inner peace, a renewed sense of energy, clearheadedness, and a strong immune system.    ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================  About Your Spiritual Teacher - Rollin McCraty  Rollin McCraty, PhD, is the director of research of the HeartMath Research Center at HeartMath Institute. As a psychophysiologist, Dr. McCraty’s research interests include the physiology of emotion, with a focus on the mechanisms by which emotions influence cognitive processes, behavior, and health, as well as the global interconnectivity between people and the earth’s energetic systems. Findings from this research have been applied to the development of tools and technology to optimize individual and organizational health, performance, and quality of life.    Dr. McCraty has acted as principal investigator in numerous laboratory research studies examining the effects of emotions on heart-brain interactions and on autonomic, cardiovascular, hormonal, and immune system function. He has also served as principal investigator in a number of field studies to determine the outcomes of positive emotion-focused interventions and heart-rhythm feedback in diverse organizational and educational settings, as well as in various clinical populations.  Testimonials for Rollin McCraty  &quot;Dr. McCraty and the HeartMath research opened me to a whole new understanding of intuition and heart intelligence. I discovered by practicing the heart coherence techniques that it is possible to tap into the flow of intelligence and deeper wisdom anytime. I cannot imagine living any other way.&quot; — Sarah Moor    &quot;HeartMath changed my life. I was always stressed out, worried, and anxious, and tried many ways to improve my wellbeing. Nothing really worked or had long-lasting results. These techniques, that are so practical and easy to learn, are also very powerful and transformative. And the best thing is that anyone can learn and benefit from them! I have seen amazing results in my teenage children, my family, friends, and colleagues. When people around you start noticing that you are calmer and more composed, less stressed, and these energetics remain, you know you are on the right path. I am so grateful for all the research and work that Dr. McCraty and the HeartMath team do to make these great teachings accessible to everyone. I truly hope this reaches as many people as possible, because living from our hearts is exactly what we need right now.&quot; — Liliana Navarro    &quot;My HeartMath personal practice is helping me be more present and engaged in daily living. The more I grow through this practice, the more I experience my personal superpowers and heart’s desires in everyday situations!&quot; — J. Miles    &quot;Dr. McCraty’s expertise, knowledge, and understanding in the field of human transformation and potential is impressive. I am grateful for his lifelong dedication to researching and sharing the science behind the power of our hearts and how to align the mind, body, and emotions to optimize our potential. Through his research, Dr. McCraty not only offers new tools to help human beings live more coherent and harmonious lives, his work offers a new paradigm from which we can start understanding and viewing ourselves and our world as we are: fundamentally integrated, electromagnetic, and vibrational beings, versus merely chemical and mechanical beings. The HeartMath techniques were a huge blessing in my life as they helped me refocus, refresh, and renew my physiological and emotional strength. I gained the ability to disconnect emotionally from the stressors in my daily routine and have been able to return to a healthy place where I gain peace and resilience.&quot; — Brigette Wagner    &quot;The HeartMath tools and techniques have literally become the baseline of my everyday life. The awareness that each of us has the capacity to essentially flip a switch and, on demand, align our internal states syncing our heart, brain, and nervous systems, has been truly life-changing. I have learned to establish inner balance, regardless of my external environment. It impacts my presence, how I listen, and how I communicate in my relationships, and ultimately it has inspired me to have more compassion for myself and others. A true gift in these times!&quot; — Donna K.  ===================================  ↘️ Click here to register for free. ↙️  ===================================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you’ll be able to get the recording afterwards.

 "description": "Discover the healing power of tuning-forks to:      Release trapped fear and anxiety    And tune in to trust, aliveness, and creativity    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  What You\'ll Learn During &quot;Sound Healing Alchemy&quot;  During challenging times it’s easy to get locked into stress and other heavy, difficult emotions.    Whether you’re in tune with your feelings or not, many of us are experiencing more fear, anxiety, frustration, anger, overwhelm, and grief than perhaps ever have before.    And as you’re most likely aware, when you don’t acknowledge and work through these difficult feelings, they can become energetically stuck in your body, zapping your life-force energy, and even setting off chain reactions that can cause physical and emotional dis-ease.    What affects your immune system affects your electric health as well.    That’s because the life-force energies flowing through and around you — in what sound-therapy pioneer Eileen McKusick calls your biofield — have electromagnetic qualities that become disharmonized when your system is out of balance.    The good news is that sound, in the form of the coherent vibrations and tones of a medical tuning fork, can reduce this dissonance and resistance in your body’s electrical system.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================    This proven sound-healing modality actually harmonizes the optimal flow of your electromagnetic energy, enhancing your immunity and promoting an overall state of wellbeing.    And if you’ve ever experienced Eileen’s virtual biofield tunings, you know that they also feel really amazing, generally providing a soothing state of relaxation and calm.    During a treatment, you sit back as she sends out tuning-fork vibrations to detect imbalances — and listens for sound that indicates that balance or resonance has been established.    Simply put, sound healing using a tuning fork creates vibrational frequencies that allow the body to &quot;tune&quot; and reset itself.  Why You Should Attend &quot;Sound Healing Alchemy&quot;  During this fascinating hour with Eileen, she’ll take you to your very foundation to help you start to harmonize your emotions and electric health. During these disorienting times feelings of fear can embed deeply into your bones.    Medical research shows that increased stress, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental factors can cause a lifetime of negative effects, degrading bone tissue, and reducing bone mass.    Eileen teaches us that we hold the chaotic chaotic energies and vibrational dissonance of our heavy emotions throughout our body.    Universally, for example, despair and grief are held in the heart and lungs; anger, powerlessness, and regret in the solar plexus; guilt, shame, disappointment, and victimhood in the lower gastrointestinal tract.    Lack of or ineffective emotional management is the biggest impediment to our electric — and overall — health, according to Eileen.    The remedy is to tune in to our emotions. Learn how to locate where they show up energetically in our bodies. Learn how to work with them, and transmute them.    We can become an emotional alchemist by befriending and making peace with heavy emotions — and when we do this, the lighter, healing emotion (or antidote) will emerge. We discover that beneath our grief and despair is love and gratitude; beneath our fear is trust and a deep knowing.    Beneath it all, you discover that your essential nature is courage, aliveness, and playfulness.    As an emotional alchemist, you learn to breathe easier, you become more resilient, and you liberate your emotional energy for more creativity and joy.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  Class Topics for &quot;Sound Healing Alchemy&quot;  During this vibration-boosting 75 minutes with Eileen, you’ll:      Discover the importance of your electric health in boosting your immunity, mood, and overall wellbeing    Learn the keys to becoming an emotional alchemist, transmuting difficult feelings and bringing more harmony, resilience, and playfulness into your life    Discover how sound healing can help you tune in to where your body holds difficult emotions and harmonize those vibrational energies to liberate the healing positive emotions beneath    Discover your bone health as core to your vitality — and what happens to your skeletal system when you’re afraid    Experience a tuning-fork sound treatment to feel your bones, libratate the fear they hold, and uncover the antidote of greater awareness and trust beneath    Experience a guided meditation with a tuning-fork treatment for a deep presencing of what it feels like to be yourself — separate from your busy mind    Eileen is a pioneering researcher in sound-healing therapy and has spent more than 20 years exploring and mapping the human biofield.    She has discovered that the human biofield contains a very specific anatomy and physiology, and that it can be successfully modulated with the tone of a simple medical tuning fork to produce consistent and useful therapeutic outcomes.    Her methods are noninvasive and easy to learn — and you’ll have the opportunity to experience them for yourself during this complimentary mini-workshop.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================  About Your Sound Healing Teacher - Eileen McKusick  Eileen McKusick is a researcher, writer, inventor, practitioner, educator, and speaker on the effects of audible sound on the human body and biofield. Elieen, who has an MA in Integrative Education, has been researching sound since 1996.    She is the originator of Biofield Tuning (with thousand of students trained worldwide since 2010), the founder of the Biofield Tuning Institute (which conducts grant-funded, IRB-approved, and peer-reviewed studies on the human biofield), and author of the award-winning, bestselling book, Tuning the Human Biofield: Healing with Vibrational Sound Therapy. She is also the inventor of the revolutionary and much-loved tool, the Sonic Slider, and the CEO of BioSona, LLC, which provides sound-therapy tools and training globally.    Eileen is a pioneer in the fields of therapeutic sound and electric health — her work leads people from a chemical/mechanical perspective of life, health, and the universe to an electro-sonic one.    This new perspective makes health and life easier, connects the dots for people, and ties together multiple concepts in an elegant, easy-to-grasp way. Eileen\'s work, which creates an accessible bridge between what’s been considered pseudoscience and what’s been considered scientific, leads people to a much greater sense of personal empowerment.    Eileen, who lives in Burlington, Vermont, and Negril, Jamaica, travels extensively teaching and presenting at conferences worldwide, where she’s considered to be a dynamic, engaging, and inspiring presenter. She just wrapped up writing her second book, Raise Your Voltage, due in January 2021 from St. Martin\'s Press.    =====================  ↘️ Click Here To Register For Free ↙️  =====================    🌟 Even if you can’t attend live... 🌟    Register now because you\'ll be able to get a copy of the recording afterwards.
